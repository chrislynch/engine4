You can <a href="http://www.blogtalkradio.com/scifipulse/2010/02/28/episode-58--featuring-comics-writer-chris-lynch">listen online via Blog Talk Radio</a> or <a href="http://phobos.apple.com/WebObjects/MZStore.woa/wa/viewPodcast?id=318557249">download for iTunes</a>.

I heard from Ian at Sci Fi Pulse today that the interview is Blog Talk Radio's "Pick of the Day", which is great news and no doubt a testament to Ian's editing skills!

I had a great time recording this, I can't imagine how much effort went into editing my almost endless manic rambling down into something useful, but kudos to the guys at Sci Fi Pulse for managing it.

Next podcast from me will be a very cheeky interview with the ladies of <a href="http://comicspodcastsuk.wordpress.com/main-page/comic-racks/">Comic Racks</a>, in which <a href="http://stuartt1975.wordpress.com/">Stuart</a> misbehaves himself a great deal.
