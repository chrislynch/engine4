I have just listened to it and can indeed confirm the following ...
<ol>
	<li>I say "Basically", "You know", "So", and "Um" ... quite a lot, basically, you know?</li>
	<li>My voice gets ludicrously high pitched when I get a bit excited.</li>
	<li>I have cursed myself to decorate or fall foul of a terrible fate in October</li>
	<li>There is no such thing as a dance acamdemy for bees</li>
	<li>I do not own a Nokia 3210, but have done and have a disturbingly impressive knowledge of the specification.</li>
	<li>My only good advice for other comic writers is to marry an English Teacher</li>
</ol>
So, if want to find out what kind of interview can possibly cover such strange and rambling ground, I recommend <a href="http://comicbookoutsiders.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=570134">Comic Book Outsiders Episode 68</a>!
