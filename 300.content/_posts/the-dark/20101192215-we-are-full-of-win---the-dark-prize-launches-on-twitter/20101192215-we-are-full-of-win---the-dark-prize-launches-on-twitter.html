#We Are Full Of Win - The Dark Prize Launches On Twitter#

To celebrate the launch of The Dark, we have arranged a very special prize draw, with our esteemed publisher Markosia, to win a signed copy of <a href="http://www.thedarkcomicbook.com">The Dark</a>. The competition is simple to enter, just tweet our URL "<a href="http://www.thedarkcomicbook.com"><strong>http://www.thedarkcomicbook.com</strong></a>" anytime between now and January 31st. Every tweet will count as an entry, and a winning tweet (and tweeter) will be selected at random on February 1st 2010.

It would be fantastic if we could make The Dark a trending topic on Twitter, but I'll settle for knowing that we've got the word out there to comics fandom and that someone, somewhere, will be enjoying a copy of The Dark gratis. As they say in the National Lottery adverts ... <em>Maybe, just maybe ...</em>
