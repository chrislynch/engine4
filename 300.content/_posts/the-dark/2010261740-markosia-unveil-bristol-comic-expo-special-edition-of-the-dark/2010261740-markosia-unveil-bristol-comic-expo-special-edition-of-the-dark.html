<blockquote><a href="http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/TheDark_BristolCover.GIF"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1048" style="margin-left: 15px; margin-right: 15px;" title="The Dark Bristol Cover" src="http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/TheDark_BristolCover-202x300.GIF" alt="The Dark Bristol Cover" width="202" height="300" /></a>To celebrate the launch of their new graphic novel, "The Dark", Markosia are producing a special edition of the book exclusively for Bristol Expo visitors.

With a variant cover from series artist Rick Lundeen, there will be only one hundred of these individually signed and numbered editions available.

A great opportunity to read the graphic novel that critics are calling "<em>highly original</em>", "<em>a great, fast read</em>",   "<em>confident</em>" and "<em>some of Chris Lynch's best work to date" </em>as well as owning a piece of comics history. The Dark's author, Chris Lynch, will be at the Markosia stand throughout Comic Expo!</blockquote>
The Bristol Comic Expo is an immensely important event for me as a creator. It is were I had my first self publishing experiences, were I first met most of the many good friends I now have in the comics community, were I first met Harry Markos and discovered Markosia, and were I first made the decision that <em>this</em>, this crazy comic book making thing ... <em>this</em> was what I wanted to do. Forever.

It feels great to be bring the special edition of The Dark to the show were, for me, it all started. All that remains is for me to get on an sign and <em>individually number every single one</em> <em>of them</em>*.
<h6>* Yes, I know. I said in my interview with Comic Book Outsiders that I would never individually number anything by hand ever again. I think Harry Markos was listening, and this is his revenge.</h6>
