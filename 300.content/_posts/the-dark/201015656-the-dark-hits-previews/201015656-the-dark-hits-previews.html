<strong>Our Diamond Order Code is JAN100699.</strong>

The advert in previews features the OGN Cover by Rick Lundeen and the following about the book:
<blockquote>(W) Chris Lynch (A) Rick Lundeen.

Imagine a story that you can drink, a story that you can feel, a story you can live. Welcome to the city of Dante, and the world of Memetech. As a wave of drugs that create living stories sweeps his city, one man fights back as 'The Dark'. A vigilante who wields fiction as a weapon, he is the last hope for a city where nothing is what it seems. A stunning new sci-fi thriller.</blockquote>
Online retailers are already starting to the list The Dark for pre-order. Orders for The Dark will need to be in before the end of January 2010, so please make sure you let your local comic store know about the book and order <em>your</em> copy. As most people know, Diamond reserve the right to drop any book that does not meet their minimum order benchmark, so it is crucial that we get all the orders that we can.

Rick, the team at Markosia, and myself are all working hard on promoting the book, so expect to see a lot of press over the next few days and weeks.

Most importantly, of course, <strong>please</strong> <strong>order your copy of The Dark from your local comic shop today!</strong>
