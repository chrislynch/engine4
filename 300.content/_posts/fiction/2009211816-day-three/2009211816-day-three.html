<blockquote>“I’m not sure why I’ve started this diary today. I found the notebook and the pens a few nights ago while I was hunting through the kitchens for food. I’m not even sure why I took them, as I’m trying not to carry anything more than essentials with me from day to day now. I guess I just want to leave something behind when I’m gone and I’m sure that that time isn’t too far away. I want to record what’s happened to me, to the others, so that anyone who finds this will know to get off this island as quickly as they can and never come back. Maybe I just need to talk to someone, even if it myself, to drown out the noise of the drums.”</blockquote>
