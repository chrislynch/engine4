<blockquote>The princess dropped her bedding slightly, revealing the top of the intricate lace-work of a bodice. “And being all alone for so much of the time, just thinking and dreaming,” she said, her voice husky now and audibly dripping with intent, “One has the opportunity to acquire some most remarkable tastes.”

“A bodice?” said the thief with a smile. “How positively medieval. “It is the twenty first century you know.” Dropping his sack to the floor, he advanced on the bed, pulling his knife from it’s sheath.

“You won’t need that,” said the princess. “I won’t scream.”

“If you scream,” said the thief, slipping his knife away, “Rest assured that I won’t need it.”</blockquote>
