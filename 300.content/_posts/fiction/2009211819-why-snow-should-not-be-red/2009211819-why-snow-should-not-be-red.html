@Title:Why Snow Should Not Be Red

#Why Snow Should Not Be Red#

Why Snow Should Not Be Read was originally due to appear in <a href="http://www.davidhayesonline.com/">David Haye’s</a> new Masters of the Macabre anthology. When that publication was cancelled, it became the prose feature in Monkeys with Machineguns #2.
<blockquote>I did Peter and Jenny quicker. I was still Daddy after all, and they were good kids. They stood still when I told them to, even with Mummy crawling back from the stairwell, trailing red slush behind her. I think she might have tried to call out to them, but the patch of skull that I had stripped from her head must have been one of the parts that connected her jaw to her face; it hung down like a broken drawbridge, and she could only grunt and scream hoarsely as she hauled herself across the icy roof.</blockquote>
