Ten stirred milk and sugar into her coffee as she awkwardly scrolled through the address book on her phone with her off hand. On the tiny screen, the time flipped to 14:53. Sarah was never late, and Ten really wanted to make her call before Sarah got here. Sarah was a good friend, but there were some things that she just didn't understand, and Michael was one of them.
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Ten hit the green “call” button, and waited as the phone rang. And rang. The time flipped to 14:54, and Michael's familiar voicemail message sprang into crackling, noisy life. “Hi, this is Michael. I can't get to a phone right, so leave a message after the beep.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Ten sighed. It was hardly the most imaginative message in the world.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“Hi Michael,” she said, still stirring her coffee. “It's just me. Checking in … I just wanted to let you know I'm doing fine. I'm meeting up with Sarah today, just for coffee. Everything's fine and, well … I miss you babe. Get in touch, OK?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Ten hung up, and quickly took a sip from her coffee, hoping the cup would somehow envelope her face her hide the tears that had slipped traitorously from her eyes. 14:57. She didn't want to be crying when Sarah got here. On an adjacent table, an elderly woman pretended not to be looking at Ten, and Ten pretended not to notice. She hated crying in public, but it had been so difficult lately, since Michael had come back into her life.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">It was 14:59 when Sarah walked in. If Ten had had a stop watch, she could have marked it as exactly 14:50 when Sarah dropped her handbag on the table. She truly was never late.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“Hey, you OK?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Ten took another sip of coffee. “Sure,” she replied. “Coffee's hot, burnt my tongue.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Sarah raised an eyebrow. “Sure. Well, maybe I'd better get myself some of that. In case, you know, I want to burn my tongue as well.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Ten watched as Sarah breezed over to the counter and ordered. She watched her wait. Ever since Michael, she had become fascinated by the most mundane things. She wondered what was going on in Sarah's head at that very moment, what thoughts might be occupying her as she waiting for her cup of coffee. Ten's mind, at all times, as consumed with thoughts of Michael. She wondered, perhaps, how other people coped without him in their lives.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“He left you too, you know,” Ten blurted the moment Sarah had returned. Sarah's coffee cup clattered the last two inches down onto the table.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“Excuse me?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“Michael,” Ten continued. “It's not just me he left, is it? He left you too.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Sarah sat down. The elderly woman ceased even to pretend not be paying rapt attention to the scene between the two young women. Ten couldn't believe she'd said it. She'd promised herself that she wouldn't talk to Sarah about Michael. She'd promised Michael that she wouldn't talk to Sarah about Michael.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Ten's phone buzzed in her handbag.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“Don't tell me that's him,” Sarah said sharply. “I don't want to hear it.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“He wants to see you,” said Ten. She tried to keep her voice level, passive, persuasive. “He misses you too. That's why he came back.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Ten's phoned buzzed again, and she reached for her handbag.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“Don't!” snapped Sarah. “Just … don't.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Ten slid her hand across the table towards Sarah. “Sarah, you two were so close. Maybe if you ...”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Sarah pulled back, out of Ten's reach. “Listen, Kate,” she said, “Whoever it is you think you're talking to, it isn't Michael. I mean, you haven't even spoken to him, it's just text messages. It's some sick bastard's idea of a game, and it's being played on both of us. Michael's not back. He's not coming back. Ever. It can't happen.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Ten's phoned buzzed, seeming more insistent this time than before. Ten didn't reach for it. She didn't reach for Sarah. She just sat, motionless and utterly alone in her own thoughts. She had had the same doubts at first, of course she had. But Michael had left so suddenly, there was bound to be unfinished business. Unfinished business with Sarah, unfinished business with Ten.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“I don't go by Kate any more,” said Ten, finally breaking the silence. “My name's Ten.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“His name for you,” said Sarah softly. “His 'Ten'”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Ten nodded. “How would someone else know that, Sarah?” she pleaded. “How?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Sarah pushed her coffee away and picked up her handbag. “I don't know, Kate. I don't know how someone would know that. I don't know why someone would do any of this. But someone is. And you're letting them play you. You're letting them win.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“And if you're wrong?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Sarah stood and turned away. Ten could tell from the quaking in Sarah's shoulders that she was crying.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“And if you're wrong, Sarah?”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“My brother is dead, Kate,” said Sarah, her back still turned. “Michael is gone.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">And with that, Sarah was gone as well. Ten sat and watched her go, in doubt this time as to what thoughts were in her head. She hadn't wanted to upset Sarah, hadn't wanted to scare her. After Michael had died, she had been Ten's only link, her only connection to any of Michael's family or friends. Ten didn't want to lose her.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">The phone buzzed again, this time shaking the whole handbag.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“Alright, alright,” said Ten, plucking the phone out. A tiny envelope spun around on the screen, the words “4 NEW MESSAGES” flashing underneath. Her hand trembling, Ten read them aloud one by one.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“Tell her that it's me. Even if she won't believe it.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“Make her believe, Ten. I need her to believe to.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“This isn't a game, please believe in me. I need you to believe. It's me, Ten, it's Michael. Please.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“I'm not gone. I'm not. Please believe.”</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">Ten stopped. She had realised that the elderly lady from the next table, now on to her second cup of coffee, was listening so intently that she had slowly drifted forward in her seat. Before Ten could say something to her, another message rattled the phone in her hand. Ten's brow furrowed as she read the message, then she smiled. Michael had always had a wicked sense of humour. She turned to face the woman head on, and read the last message.</p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="LEFT">“And tell the old bat on the next table I'll be seeing her. Real soon.”</p>
