Yep, BICS rocked. It rocked in a very special way.

To steal a trick from Nick Horby here, in no particular order other than the order that my brain spewed them forth, are my favourite moments:
<ol>
	<li>Getting a trading card of "The Dark" from Sy Wyatt</li>
	<li>Almost making Amy Liff faint/vomit/both with an impromtu rendition of the classic children's showtune "Tranny Wingman".</li>
	<li>Sharing Supernatural love with The Nuge</li>
	<li>Getting the original art for my "Fictionalist" avatar from Rob</li>
	<li>Making Stuart admit that I loved Supernatural first, that he mocked my Supernatural love, but he is now addicted to it</li>
	<li>Carpet Jaeger-bombing as many people as possible in a sudden burst of prodigious drinking</li>
	<li>Seeing a giant Optimus Prime figure</li>
	<li>Selling off the remaining stock of MWM #1, MWM #2, and MWM Live!</li>
	<li>Finding out how many people actually liked MWM Live but getting away with not having to do it again</li>
	<li>Spilling scalding hot tea down myself whilst pitching</li>
	<li>Meeting Neal and the ironically named "Little Fat Mikey"</li>
	<li>The water colour of The Dark from Valia</li>
	<li>Terrifying Mr. Cola with my second rendition of "Tranny Wingman"</li>
	<li>Sharing table space with the hardcore crew of Orang Utan Comics and David Wynne.</li>
	<li>Free hotel WiFi</li>
	<li>Marveling at the talents of my partner in crime Stu.Art as he sketched up a storm</li>
	<li>Freaking out David Wynne with a "I wanna sex you up" duet with Ian Sharman</li>
</ol>
And the truth is, this list could go on and on. I sang at least three others songs for starters and I still haven't listed the fun times with the Mighty McAuliffes, the numerous (by which I mean 2) Staceys, Monts tales of Merlin, Belgian Dave, Ryan and Orko (virtually cannon fodder to my J-Bombs, bless their young hearts), wonderfully erudite exchanges with Scott Grandison, comedy ranting like a lunatic at Jimmy Bott, ... and even as I try to draw this paragraph to a close I am sure I am missing someone or something <em>vital</em>. Probably more than one.

To put it as simply as I can 48+ hours of unadulterated comics is good, 48 hours of comics with this company is simple unbeatable. Except perhaps by 72 hours.
