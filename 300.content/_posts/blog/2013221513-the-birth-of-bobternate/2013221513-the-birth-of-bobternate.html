@Title:The Birth Of Bobternate

## Pitch: An Eastenders/Doctor Who/Fringe Crossover - "The Birth of Bob-Ternate"


Eastenders bossing are re-casting the role of "Bobby Beale" so that the actor currently in the role can focus on his school work. 

Recastings in soap operas are not uncommon, and Eastenders is no exception. The Beale family are particularly prone to Galifrean regenerations; there have been four different Lucys, five Peters, and four Stephens. Arthur Fowler, Ian Beale's uncle, was once replaced for a whole episode by a bench.

What I do find mysterious is that the BBC have not taken advantage of this phenomenon sooner and made these transformations a part of the show.

This, I think, should be Bobby Beale's destiny. Imagine the ratings boost if...

## Bobby Beale uses the Chameleon Arch and becomes the Master

Eastenders needs a great villian, there's always a bit of argee-bargee on the square. What better way to ramp up the tension for Christmas episode than one of the Master's nefarious plans?

Actually there is [well documented history of crossing over between Easters and Dr Who](http://tardis.wikia.com/wiki/EastEnders) and [the Tardis has landed in Walford](http://www.doctorwhonews.net/2011/01/dwn180111180008-east-end-tardis.html) before. This could actually happen!

## Bobby Beale crosses over into an alternate dimension and is replaced by Bob-Ternate

Normal, amiable, Bobby is replaced by a sinister and malevolent version of himself, intent on taking ownership of The Queen Vic and the Fruit and Veg stall. We know which version of Bobby is being dropped off or picked up from school that day by Ian by the colour of the credits (they are already blue ... think about it)

## At the very least, Bobby's dad (not of entirely sound mind) notices the difference

Joking apart, I think this would be a fun nod towards the issue, although I doubt the Eastenders team want to make too much fun out of Ian's nervous breakdown. Having said that, there **was** a comedy hat ...

Should Bobby become Bob-ternate? **YOU DECIDE!**
