@Title:Custom Comic Books Covers from Rob Jackson

Artist extraordinaire Rob Jackson is taking commissions for custom comic book covers.


You can check out his process and his prices at his new site [Let Me Draw That](http://letmedrawthat.blogspot.co.uk/)

Rob created my steampunk-writer avatar for me around the time that I was working on The Dark (check the sneaky inclusion of The Dark's sigil on the giant-pen blade). Of all the bits of artwork I've ever received in my inbox, this one is still one of my favourites. It also makes me smile because it made Rob say "steampunk stuff is hard as sh*t". I like to hurt artists, it is what they deserve.
