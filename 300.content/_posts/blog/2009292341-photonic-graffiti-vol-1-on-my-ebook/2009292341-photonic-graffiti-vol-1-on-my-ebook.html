#Photonic Graffiti Vol #1 On My-eBook#

Volume #1 of my fumetti styled web comic, Photonic Graffiti, is now available from my eBook. <a href="http://www.myebook.com/index.php?option=ebook&amp;id=4353">Click here to go straight to Photonic Graffiti Volume #1.</a>

Photonic Graffiti has previously appeared in Monkeys with Machineguns #2 and in <a href="http://www.indyplanet.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=480">J.S. Earl's "Frameworks" anthology</a>.

As a committed non-drawer, fumetti is about as close as I can get in comics to working single handed. My thanks go out to all the skilled photographers who have licensed their work so that I can scrawl all over it.
