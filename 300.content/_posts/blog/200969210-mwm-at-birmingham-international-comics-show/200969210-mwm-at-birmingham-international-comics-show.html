#MWM At Birmingham International Comics Show#

<strong>The <a href="http://www.thecomicsshow.co.uk/">Birmingham International Comics Show (BICS)</a> is back, bigger and better than ever before for 2009! And, as usual, Monkeys with Machineguns will be there!</strong>

After our exhibiting hiatus at last year's BICS, we will be proudly sharing a double sized exhibitor space with the fine fellows of <a href="http://www.orangutancomics.co.uk/">Orang Utan Comics</a> and <a href="http://davidwynne.livejournal.com/">David Wynne</a> at the 2009 show. Having seen life on both sides of the table at last year's Birmingham International Comics Show, the first convention I have ever attended as anything other than an exhibitor, I think it is a fantastic show and one worthy of pride of place in the autumn/winter convention schedule.

As well as exhibiting our wares at the table I am single handledly trying to have dubbed "Monkeypalooza", Stu and I will also be spending some time at the <a href="http://www.markosia.co.uk/">Markosia</a> stand where you will be able to talk to us about our upcoming projects <a href="http://magpye.monkeyswithmachineguns.com">The Magpye</a> and <em>The Dark</em>, and at the <a href="http://www.insomniapublications.com">Insomnia Publications</a> table where I will be talking about my new project <em>The Fictionalists</em>. We will also be at the pre-show party on Friday night. At present, however, we have no plans (despite encouragement from quite a few people) to repeat the monumental feat of <strong>Monkeys with Machineguns Live! </strong>(Although, anyone who wants to see if they can goad <a href="http://www.comicspace.com/thatrogersguy/">Pete Rogers</a> and I into finally having our "write off/face off" ...)

Overall, BICS is shaping up to be a fantastic show and if you haven't already booked tickets, a table, or registered as a professional, I heartily advise the application of skates to feet ... pronto.
