@Title:Four And A Half Ways To Bring Back Agent Coulson In SHIELD

# Four and a half ways to bring back Agent Phil Coulson in S.H.I.E.L.D

The S.H.I.E.L.D TV show is go, with Joss Whedon at the helm and some faimilar Whedon-verse talent behind the scenes. The *real* buzz around this show however is the "resurrection" of Agent Phil Coulson.

**If you haven't seen Avengers - look away now. Actually, look away forever. Thanks... **

Coulson was killed by Loki on the Helicarrier, an act that forged the alliance between Avengers and "gave them something" (in the words of Nick Fury). Queue an internet meme, delivered as only nerds on the internet can, calling for the return of Coulson or spouting the conspiracy that Coulson *isn't as dead as we thought*. It is established in the Avengers that Fury "twists the knife" of Coulson's death by convincing Captain America that Coulson's precious Captain America trading cards were in his pocket when he was killed - an emotive moment for Steve Rogers and a reminder for the audience of who and what Nick Fury really *is* and the lengths that he will go to to win. The prevailing theory online therefore is that Coulson isn't dead at all, just hiding.

Personally I think this is a terrible option. Coulson's death is a pivotal moment in the movie and a poignant moment for a character who had tied together the "Phase 1" Marvel movie universe. Let's not have him hiding in a cupboard for the end of the movie. That might be Nick Fury's style, but it isn't Phil Coulson's. 

So, how do we bring back Coulson? Here's some ideas...

## 1: Coulson is a robot

There is something mechanical/robotic about Coulson. He's super polite, super calm. Nothing phases him. It is not a big leap to think that he's been an android all this time, but I prefer that idea that Phil Coulson was real and Phil Coulson died, then someone took Coulson's memories and put them into a robot.

Fury's just lost his right hand man, his go-to field operative. If someone, let's say **Hank Pym** (who hasn't made a movie appearance yet, has he?), offers him a chance to get Coulson back? Fury would jump at it.

I like this option because it leaves the door open for interaction with the Avengers in a way that "I was hiding" just doesn't. They already distrust Fury, what happens when they find out that he's brought their mutual friend back from the dead as a soulless machine? 

Add to this the fact that Hank Pym's robots have a habit of going "a bit mental", and you've got a recipe for something exciting. False memories and the question about "who we are" when we are disconnected from our bodies is ground familiar to Joss and Jed Whedon from Dollhouse, so this could be a safe bet - especially with Marvel pushing their "Age of Ultron" event in the comic book universe.

## 2: Coulson is a clone.

Coulson sure gets around, doesn't he? 

Maybe there always more than one Phil Coulson. Again, this weakens the pathos of what happened in Avengers and does skate dangerously close to the poison that is "Spider Clones", but it is not without precedent.

I think we should leave that there. Walk away *very quickly*.

## 3: Coulson is a Skrull

We thought we where getting Skrulls in Avengers, but we got some pretty disposable villains in the Chitauri instead. So, Skrulls are still available.

Again, I don't think original Coulson was a Skrull, but *new Coulson* sure could be. In fact, there are a quite a few ways that Skrull Coulson works for me, here are my two favourites...

### "Little Phil's a Skrull"

Phil's a great guy who adopted a Skrull baby, lost on Earth. Now Daddy's dead and "Little Phil" is grieving so much that he's stuck looking like his adopted Dad. He can only access his Skrull powers occasionally, so he doesn't overpower the other characters and nobody really trusts him either - he's an alien who looks like their dead friend, after all.

If Marvel want to foreshadow a "Secret Invasion" storyline for the Marvel Universe, Phil Coulson's Skrull Baby could be really useful.

### New Phil is a Skrull Ambassador

Sometime during the "Phase 1" Marvel movies, Phil Coulson is exchanged with an ambassador from the Skrull Empire in a political move by Nick Fury, desperate to form any alliance he can in the wake of Thor's arrival on Earth.

They get Phil, we get one of theirs. New Phil takes Old Phil's place and "walks a mile" in his shoes. Shoes that end up covered in blood when he's killed by Loki.

With relations between Earth and the Skrulls strained, a new ambassador arrives to take the place of his fallen comrade. Turns out Earth's a dangerous place even for a Skrull, and "New Phil" is here to clean house.

## 4: We don't know, but we think something happened to time?

<img src="Scarlet-Witch-marvel-superheroines-10397121-1280-581.jpg" />

News has spread on the internet that the next Avengers movie will feature Scarlet Witch and Quicksilver.

Quicksilver has a nice "movie compatible" set of powers, but the Scarlet Witch could be more of a leap - unless Marvel give her a good run in somewhere else. We've seen Wanda turn the world upside down with her reality warping powers, so who's to say that she can't bring Phil Coulson back from the dead? 

Taking this route, I'd like to see a "mystery" angle to Coulson's reappearance. He's back, but neither he nor we know how or why. Does Fury know? Maybe, but if he does then he's not telling. Instead, we get to watch Coulson put the pieces together as he and his team track down mysterious events around the globe. The shadowy player behind it all? A crazy Wanda Maximoff who can't help but change things.

Of course, if Phil takes her down, he could be signing his own death warrant.
