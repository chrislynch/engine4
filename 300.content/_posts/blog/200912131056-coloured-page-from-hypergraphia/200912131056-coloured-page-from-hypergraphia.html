#Coloured Page From Hypergraphia#

<a href="http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Hyper001_colour_mail.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-993" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;" title="Hyper001_colour_mail" src="http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/12/Hyper001_colour_mail-198x300.jpg" alt="Hyper001_colour_mail" width="198" height="300" /></a>I received this fantastic page from Valia today. Although the final print of the story in Insomnia's "Survival" anthology will be in black and white, the colours were simply too fantastic for me to keep them tucked away in my inbox.

A disturbing amount of people how now joined our "<a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=190668378067">I want to be killed by Chris and Valia</a>" Facebook group and we are having great fun coming up with horrible ways to dispose of you all.

As far as I know "Survival" will be out in time for the <a href="http://www.fantasyevents.org/bristolcomicexpo/">Bristol Comic Expo</a>.
