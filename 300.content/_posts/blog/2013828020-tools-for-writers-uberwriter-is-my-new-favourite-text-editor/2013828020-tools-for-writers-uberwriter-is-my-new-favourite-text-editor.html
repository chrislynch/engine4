@Title:Tools for Writers: UberWriter is my new favourite text editor

I didn't think that I would buy into the "distraction free editor" trend. I suppose I sort of *like* my distractions. After all, a pithy reply to a tweet is a far more worthwhile piece of writing than some silly article with a looming deadline. So what if I don't get paid for tweets but do get paid to hit deadlines, *someone is wrong on the internet*.

But, actually, it turns out distraction free editors are a pretty good idea. I've not quite been converted to full screen white on black zealotry, but I do have a ***new favourite thing***

That new favourite thing is **[UberWriter](http://uberwriter.wolfvollprecht.de/)**

UberWriter is great because it does everything that I want, and nothing that I don't. If I didn't know better, and I'm not sure that I do, I would say that software creator Wolf Vollprecht has been watching me. Maybe he just knows writers, and knows what makes a good tool for them.

So, what exactly does UberWriter do? Well...

## Markdown Support

UberWriter lets me write in Markdown, and I *love* Markdown. Markdown and Bubble also have a lot in common, so UberWriter is great at editing Bubble scripts as well. I still need to copy and paste the text across from UberWriter to Bubble to get a script, but that's a very small point.

You can preview your Markdown output at any time, and export to HTML, PDF, ODT, ePub, and more. The full list of export options has to been seen to be believed, and I trust the exports to be solid as they appear to be powered by the mighty PanDoc.

## Fullscreen and Focus mode

Full screen text editors, also known as "distraction free" editors, are very en-vogue at the moment. With screen sizes and screen resolutions on the up, full screen mode can be a nice way to ditch your email and social media for a bit. Not for me *personally*, but a feature that a lot of people are looking for.

I expect to see more full screen modes in applications in the future as we are gradully reeducated from multi-tasking on our desktops to mono-tasking on our phones and tablets.

**Focus Mode** is something that I am using a lot, by comparison. In focus mode, on the sentence that you are working on is 100% opaque, with everything else fading down to about 50% opacity. The sentence you are working on also stays "glued" to the center of the window so, as you type, you don't work your way down the screen/page and don't end up looking downwards for long periods of time. Focus mode is sometimes called a "virtual typewriter" and it does remind me of my very early days of writing, where I ploughed on and hit keys and couldn't go back to change something without reaching for the correction fluid. Arguably, stories came easier back then.

For anyone needing to get their goth on, or write in the dark, there is also a "Dark Room" mode that gives you a black background with white text. This is actually quite soothing to look at when you have tired eyes, and does make your editor window jump out at you if you have it at less then full screen whilst Googling up some research (or checking Facebook).

## Persistent Word Count

My absolute **favourite** feature in UberWriter has to be the onscreen word count. It fades away when you are writing, returning if you give your mouse a quick nudge. When it is displayed, it keeps a running tally of your word and character count. For anyone getting paid by the word or working to a word count minimum or maximum, this is a fantastic feature. I wish more editors would put word count up front like this, as it is something that any professional writer has to have an eye on.

## Format Previewing and Outlining

UberWriter understands Markdown (and, as I've already mentioned, *Markdown is cool*). UberWriter semi-formats your text as you are writing it wherever it finds Markdown syntax. This is great not only as a sanity check so that you know your Markdown is solid, but it also provides a basic "outlining" tool. By out-denting (the opposite of indenting) the # marks that indicate headers, UberWriter provides a handy set of markers on the left hand side of your text to remind you where your headings are. This works brilliantly, again, with Bubble which uses # and ## for page and panel markers.

## The Downside

The downside, in a sense, is that UberWriter is only available pre-compiled on Linux. Not a downside for me, as a right thinking running of an open source operating system, but I imagine some Windows or Mac readers are feeling a like bit like they just read a massive bait and switch article here. The upside is that UberWriter is also open source, so anyone is free to pick up the sourcecode and compile it for their platform.

Personally, I'd just switch to Linux and get your word count on...
