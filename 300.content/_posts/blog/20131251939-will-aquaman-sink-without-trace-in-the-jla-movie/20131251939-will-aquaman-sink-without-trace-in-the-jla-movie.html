@Title:Will AquaMan sink without trace in the JLA movie?

io9 are carrying a story with a rumoured cast list for the vaporware JLA movie. [http://io9.com/5978818/rumor-the--justice-league-movie-snubs-aquaman](http://io9.com/5978818/rumor-the--justice-league-movie-snubs-aquaman)


Surprise surprise, no AquaMan.

On a backdrop of "AquaMan sucks" vs. "AquaMan does *not* suck debate", there are however a few voices of reason. Trawling the comments and blog posts so that you don't have to, here are the **Top 5 Reasons AquaMan won't be in the JLA Movie**

### Nobody knows who he is (By nobody, I mean normal folks)

Superman, Batman, and Wonder Woman all have established pop culture credentials. Green Lantern had a movie (honesty, he did. You can look it up). The Flash has enough iconic juice to carry him through, pretty much.

AquaMan... not so much. His most well known incarnation, in Batman The Brave and the Bold, is never going to fit in a big screen Hollywood movie. He's simply too **outrageous**.

### The movie probably won't take place out at sea

Avengers has set the template for the super hero showdown. You need a city, you need buildings to demolish, you need lots of innocents in peril. People live in cities, work in cities, shop in cities. The concept of a city being attacked and being in danger is understandable. 

If we aren't a ground level, the next most likely option is space. For those of you not in the know, space is **even further** away from the sea. 

### There is only so much screen time

The Avengers used a mix of characters who had already been introduced in their own movies or appeared in someone else's (Hawkeye is in the Thor - keep your eyes peeled True Believer). If the same model is followed for JLA, someone needs to put their money behind the **AquaMan Movie**.

OK, moving on...

### Orange is hard to CGI

I don't know if this is true, but if it is then that would be *just AquaMan's luck*

### AquaMan sucks

On a serious note, "AquaMan Sucks" is a big meme. Google it. Tumblrer it.

Somewhere in the hierarchy that will put this movie together, if indeed it ever gets put together, there are going to be people who don't know comics but do know money. And they probably also know how to Google and if they Google "AquaMan" then, King of Atlantis or no, they probably aren't going to like what they say.

It's the "Inverse Snakes on a Plane" rule, and you all made it true.

## How to Make AquaMan work in a JLA Movie

Disagree with this post? On a lot of levels, so do I. The reasoning above is based on a pretty cynical view of how I think this movie might be put together. Next post? My pitch for how AquaMan can not only fit into the JLA Movie, but **rule** it.
