@Title:Plot Debt  Is It Real

#Plot Debt ... Is It Real?#

Another email almost lost in the endless vaults of my inbox was from the wise Wes Packer, who forwarded on this little treasure ...

In this metaphor, doing things the quick and dirty way sets us up with a technical debt, which is similar to a financial debt. Like a financial debt, the technical debt incurs interest payments, which come in the form of the extra effort that we have to do in future development because of the quick and dirty design choice. We can choose to continue paying the interest, or we can pay down the principal by refactoring the quick and dirty design into the better design. Although it costs to pay down the principal, we gain by reduced interest payments in the future.”</span></em></span></blockquote>
And, like any of Wes' inspirational and though provoking emails - this got me thinking ...

I have believed for some time that good writing and good computer programming are very alike. They both require structure, consistency, an an absence of holes that bleed logic until the whole thing collapses in on itself.

So, just as you should have a plan before you have a programme, shouldn't you have a plot before you have that first paragraph?<em> And what if you're a comic book?</em>

Comic books from the "Big Three" are constantly under pressure from continuity. Characters created in the 1940s must somehow be made relevant to today, but without invalidating any of the storytelling that has gone before. Not only do you have the emotional history of the character to deal with, to avoid an inevitable clamouring of "he wouldn't do that" when you mistep, but you also have the legions of fans who know every stat, every fictional fact, and every immeasurable measure that there is to know about their favourite characters. There are people out there who know how much Superman can lift. Precisely.

As a writer, I have no time for anyone who has no time for continuity. Writing comic books means buying into that pantheon, that history, that shared experience that existing before you and will probably outlive you. DC may own the trademark and the copyright to Superman, but can they really claim to control the character? By now, hasn't Superman transcended the bounds of the comic book page, the movie theatre, the TV screen, and become a part of our culture? I believe he has and, if that's right, then DC have nothing more than the most tenuous legal argument to the "ownership" of Superman.

If you ask me, Superman belongs to the kid in the red blanket and extra pair of underpants, running around his garden and saving the world from imagined plots by Lex Luthor and Brainiac. As it should be with stories, as it should be with myths.

As part of what some people might consider a "new generation" of comic book writers, I aspire to create something that can not only escape the narrow walls of fiction that I create for it, but can also outlive me and find a life for itself in the real world. I want there to be kids in blankets pretending to be my characters, fighting my villians, and all the while oblivious to even the notion of my existence.

And perhaps, just perhaps, it will happen. And on the off-chance it will, shouldn't I be engineering a little longevity into my creations?

Hence, I've started to consider the nature of "plot debt". If I don't construct characters <em>now</em> with the right amount of resonance, with the right mix of pathos and accessibility, can I ever hope or expect for them to be anything other than temporary constructs within the boundaries of a single story? If they are going to survive in the big, wide, world, don't they need to be built that way?
