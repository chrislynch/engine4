It started as a harmless bit of fun, a Twitter hashtag kick about between <a href="http://neurotic-elf.deviantart.com/">Valia</a>, <a href="http://welshbluemeanie.blogspot.com/">Rich McAuliffe</a>, and me. Hypergraphia, you see, needs <em>victims</em>. Lots of victims. As Valia does a fine line in likenesses and cameos, we thought it would be funny to kill of Rich. So did other people. Then ... those same people wanted us to kill them as well.

They don't know how we'll do it. They don't know how the story ends. But they want <em>in</em>. Personally, I think that is just plain weird. Nice weird, in a "that would be cool, Chris" way, but still weird. Weird is the common demoninator in this fraction of oddness.

So ...

Now there is a <a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=190668378067">Facebook group for people who want Valia and I to kill them</a>, and its <em>growing</em>.

I'm writing this blog post now not to promote it, the damned thing seems to have a life of its own, but just to go on record that whatever happens next ... the story was already written. Honestly.
