@Title:March Of The Uber Geeks

		   #March Of The Uber-Geeks#
GeekDad has very kindly selected the top 100 friends that you wish you had on Twitter and provided links so that you can dutifully cyber-stalk them.

And I have obeyed.

I am now following the "<a href="http://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/05/100-geeks-you-should-be-following-on-twitter/">100 Geeks You Should Be Following On Twitter"</a> like a good boy, but on my part more as a curious social experiment to compare who tweets more often and more interestingly - the friends I have found or these professional geeks at arms.

So, check them out. I'm following them right now. You should be to.

Go. Follow!
