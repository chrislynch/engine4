		   #Contest: My Moleskine 2.0 - Stepcase Lifehack#
Lifehack are running a fantastic contest where you can win a <em>lifetime's supply of Moleskine</em> notebooks!

Well worth a look if, like me, you are a lover of paper-based productivity, planners, or stationery in general.

If you don't know Moleskine is all about ... shame on you ;-)
