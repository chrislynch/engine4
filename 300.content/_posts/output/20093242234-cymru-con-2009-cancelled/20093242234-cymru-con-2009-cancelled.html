@Title:Cymru Con 2009 Cancelled

		   #Cymru Con 2009 Cancelled#
Received news yesterday that <a href="http://www.cymrucon.co.uk/">Cymru Con</a> was cancelled, at least for this year.

Official news is that 
<blockquote>Our main sponsor has had to withdraw their financial backing, and with the current economic climate this has simply made it impossible to be able to put on a large event such as Cymru Con as we have been unable to secure further financial backing.</blockquote>
I know a number of the people who have been involved in putting this convention together and we are all obviously disappointed that it will not go ahead this year. It is certainly not for a want of effort from the likes of <a href="http://comicspodcastsuk.wordpress.com/main-page/comic-racks/">Iz McAuliffe</a>, who have fought valiantly to keep the con alive.

Still, there is always next year ...
