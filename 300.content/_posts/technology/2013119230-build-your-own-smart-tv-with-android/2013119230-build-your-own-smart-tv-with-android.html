@Title:Build Your Own Smart Tv With Android

# Build your own Smart TV using an Android Tablet


There are lots of [cheap Android Tablets](http://www.technologycentric.co.uk) out there. What always surprises me is that people only think of them as tablets, in particular getting hung up on the comparison between their particular Android tablet and the latest iPad. For me, this isn't the point.

What a cheap Android Tablet represents to me is a light, portable computing device with expandable storage and a built in touch screen display. Look at them *that* way, and what you can do with these things is almost endless.

So, today's experiment - can I turn a regular TV into a smart TV equivalent?

## What is a "Smart TV"?

For the purposes of this experiment, a Smart TV is a TV that can access the internet and play internet-based content. Our smart TV is also going to be social; keeping us up to date with email, Twitter, and Facebook.

## What do I need?

There isn't much you need to complete this one:

1. An Android Tablet with WiFi, Bluetooth, and HDMI output.
2. A TV with HDMI input
3. A HDMI lead
4. A mobile phone

## Step One. Prep the tablet.

Most Android tablets will have the majority of apps you need preinstallled. Check that the following are available and up to date:

1. Chrome
1. YouTube
1. Your Twitter Client of choice (right now I use *Twicca*)
1. Facebook

If you use any paid-for stream services, such as Netflix or Spotify, make sure these are installed and configured as well.

## Step Two. Install Remote Control Software

The next step is to install the remote control software for your Android tablet and connect it to your mobile phone.

First, download [Tablet Remote](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.tournesol.tabletremote&feature=nav_result#?t=W251bGwsMSwyLDNd) from Google Play to **both** your Android Tablet and your smartphone.

Run the software on both devices, following the configuration steps to configure and activate the new keyboard.

When the virtual keyboard is configured for both devices, you are ready to connect the devices. Make sure both devices are connected to the same WiFi network and then:

1. On the tablet, go to the "connection" section and make the device visible over Bluetooth.
1. On the smartphone, go to the "connection" section and scan for devices.

Make the connection between the two devices and you should be able to use your mobile phone as a keyboard to control your Android tablet.

## Step Three: Connect to the TV

Making the TV connection is simple. Just plug the HDMI lead to both devices and switch your TV to the relevant input.

If you have any display issues, you will find settings to control the HDMI output in the Android Settings App.

I chose to conceal my tablet neatly around behind the TV, but you can leave it out on display if you so choose.

## Step Four: Enjoy!

That's it - you now have an Apple TV/Smart TV type environment that will keep you connected socially, allow you to browse the web, watch video, play music, etc.
