@Title:How To Syndicate Your Blog Posts To Facebook And Twitter

## Or "My Blog is the Centre of the Universe"


[@welshpixie](https://twitter.com/WelshPixie) asked on Twitter today if anyone still "blogged" or if microblogging had killed the noble art of writing text longer than 140 characters. Queue large discussion, with people from all ends of the spectrum, and the tweet from [@utahcon](https://twitter.com/utahcon) **"My dream. I blog, it syndicates to Twitter/FB/G+/etc -- Any comments made through those are gathered back into my blog comments."**

Which, it turns out, is kind of how my blog now works. So, for those who want to know, here's **How to link your blog to your social media channels**

### Step 1: RSS

The clue is in the name - Really Simple Syndication. If your current blog/CMS doesn't support RSS feeds, either get them installed or ditch it. When I switched this blog over to my homebrew engine4 CMS, the first feature I knew I **had** to add was RSS.

RSS is the tool that we're going to use to let all the other networks know what is going on whenever we post a new article to our blog.

### Step 2: Sign up to Twitter Feed

[Twitter Feed](http://www.twitterfeed.com) is a free service that will publish your RSS feed to Twitter, Facebook, LinkedIn, and App.net.

You can sign up for Twitter Feed using a variety of different online accounts and once you have signed up the process for creating your feed is pretty simple.

### Step 3: Add your RSS feed to Twitter Feed (Step 1)

1. From the "dashboard" click "Create New Feed"
1. Give the feed and name and paste in the feed URL. (Mine is [http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/xml/rss](http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/xml/rss))
1. Test the feed, to make sure it is working.
1. Open up the "Advanced Settings"
1. Set the frequency to 30 minute checks. You may not blog every 30 minutes, but you probably don't want to wait more than 30 minutes for your post to start syndicating.
1. Set the max updates as high as you can - this will give you a little flurry of activity straight away and make sure that you don't lose multiple posts.
1. Set the Post Content and URL shortening to your preferences. I used Title+Description and bit.ly.
1. Set the Sort Order to pubDate, to pick up the most recent posts.

There are also options here for Keyword filtering and adding some tags/content - configure these to your preferences, but remember that you only have 140 characters when posting to Twitter.

### Step 4: Configure your Publishing Services on Twitter Feed (Step 2)

Twitter Feed can post to Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, and App.net.

Sign in to each one that you want to use and authorise the Twitter Feed app to do what it needs to do.

You only need to add each account once, even if you are working with multiple feeds.

For each service you will have the option of adding UTM tags. If you use Google Analytics, these will allow you differentiate where your blog traffic is coming from when users follow your syndicated links. If you don't use Google Analytics, or do don't need this right now, this can be safely ignored and reconfigured later.

### Step 5: Test it!

Once you have added at least one service, save your feed and head back to the dashboard.

You should see your feed in the dashboard along with the option to "check now!". Hit "check now!" to see how things are working. Don't expect things to be immediate - clicking check now just puts your blog in the queue to be processed ahead of schedule. 

### Step 6: Do more blogging.

Assuming that all has gone to plan, you will see posts start appearing on your social networks in line with your blogging activity. All you have to do now is blog, remembering that each blog post will automatically syndicate as per the settings that you have entered into Twitter Feed.

## Tips and Tricks 

### Help! I don't know what my feed URL is!

Check the address bar of your browser when you are looking at your blog for the RSS icon.

Click on the icon and copy the URL that your browser goes to.

### If I post more than the "Max Posts", the posts get lost

This is a feature of Twitter Feed. When it reads your RSS feed, it will take the **X** most recent articles and syndicate them and ignore everything else. When it next checks your feed, it only wants **new content**, and will ignore posts that it has seen before but not published.

### I want to post different things to Twitter and Facebook and LinkedIn.

You can do this by creating adding the same feed to Twitter Feed multiple times. Each Twitter Feed feed can have its own configuration, filters, etc.
