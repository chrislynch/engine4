#Tech Tip: Online Image Map Tool#

Today's tech tip is a quick an easy way to make image maps, something I've always found quite fiddly and time consuming. There are tools that you can download to do this and, of course, a lot of HTML IDEs do this, but if you're a little bit of a purist and you like to cut your HTML in a text editor ... image maps are a pain!

So, for a quick and easy way to create an image map wherever you are ... check out <a href="http://www.image-maps.com/">Image Map It Today</a>.

The folk at Image Map like you leave a very small (2x2px) image link in your code, just so they can track how many people have used their software, and for what. Seems like a reasonable trade, but it is easily removed from the code if you aren't happy with it.
