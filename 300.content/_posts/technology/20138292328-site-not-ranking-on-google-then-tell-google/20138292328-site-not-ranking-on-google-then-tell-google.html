@Title:Site not ranking on Google? Then tell Google!

Google's Matt Cutts tweeted yesterday


> If there's a small website that you think should be doing better in Google, tell us more here: [https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Czwk15Yc_-zcnnlvqTuspEnz2Sn3Aw2JxhkWvoVxVS4/viewform](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1Czwk15Yc_-zcnnlvqTuspEnz2Sn3Aw2JxhkWvoVxVS4/viewform)

Google's algorithm has long been biased towards large sites and large brands, so most SEO pundits are seeing this as a positive move. If Google are serious on focusing on quality, it does makes sense to use the best quality measuring device on the planet to find it... and that's people.

Google using its users to improve search results is nothing new, of course. One of the established signals for Google Adwords and Google Organic ranks is click-through rate. By tracking which of the 10 options you select when presented with the answer to a query, Google can work out if it showed you the best answer to your query in position #1, #2, or #3. From Google's presumed perspective they have failed in their mission if you have to move to page 2 of the search results, or even scroll to the hellish regions that exist *below the fold*.

However, If Google wanted to find out what the *average user* thought was a good site that wasn't well represented in the search engine's index was, Matt Cutts' tweet would be and odd way to get the word out that they wanted this input. Matt's followers are a very specific audience of web &amp; SEO savvy people. So, if Matt is asking for this information, you've got to wonder what is it that Google are *really* trying to find out?

Like Google's Webmaster Tools Disavow feature, is this another example of Google attempting to crowdsource algorithm changes and get the SEO community to start policing itself? I think that this could be the case. To me, this looks like the ulimate in peer review; nobody who has taken any SEO short cuts is going to want to put their site under Google's microscope _but_ if I'm a webmaster who has followed all of Google's best practice, not taken any short cuts, and yet still find my good quality website languishing in the SEO "long grass" then this tweet is going to look like a golden opportunity.

For Google, who are preaching quality but not necessarily delivering it, the information is vital too. If quality sites are not ranking as they should, it means something is ***wrong with the algorithm***.

Something is wrong with the algorithm... and they need our help to fix it. Let's get to work, shall we?
