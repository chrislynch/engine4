@Title:All your comments are belong to us: Why Google+ Comments in Blogger is bigger than you think.

[Google have announced the Blogger now has support for in-line Google+ comments.](http://googleblog.blogspot.co.uk/2013/04/bringing-google-comments-to-blogger.html)


If this sounds like no big deal to you, step back and think about the *bigger picture*.

Google+ is the strongest social signal in Google's algorithm, especially when you are searching Google as a logged in user. Here's some evidence...

And if that evidence isn't enough for you, here's some logic...

1. **Google want you to use Google+**. 
2. Google want Google+ to appear on as many webpages as Facebook and Twitter so that people use it more often and it can attract new users
3. Google make Google+ important to webmasters and SEO practitioners by making it part of the algorithm, so they all implement Google+

Do Google really cynically manipulate the behaviour of website owners in this way? They certainly control activity, by controlling the search index and enforcing what they view as "good" behaviour. Whether or not this is cynical depends on what you think their motivations are for doing that - simple profit making or "to organize the world’s information and make it universally accessible and useful" as per their mission statement.

The important thing to take onboard is that Google+ comments just became a lot more powerful than they once were, because they are moving outside the "walled garden" of Google+ itself and becoming part of the wider web.

## Phase 1: Blogger becomes more powerful

There is an accepted wisdom that "Wordpress is good for SEO" (a topic for another blog post). By integrating the strongest social signal into its own platform, Google have tipped the playing field back in their favour. It is important to take into account, as well, that there are more people with Google+ accounts every day, which means more users who don't need to authenticate themselves before they post a comment. With the half-life on the desire to write a comment being incredibly short, this is another important change.

In short, you can expect more comments and you can expect them to be important to your SERP position and traffic.

## Phase 2: Google+ rolls out to other platforms

This is an absolute "no brainer" for Google in my opinion. Once the embedding of the commenting system is proven and scaled in Blogger, rolling out embed code for other platforms will extend the reach of the Google+ platform exponentially.

Think about it - if you want to *organise the world's information* then taking control of the feedback loop on that information is a great idea.
