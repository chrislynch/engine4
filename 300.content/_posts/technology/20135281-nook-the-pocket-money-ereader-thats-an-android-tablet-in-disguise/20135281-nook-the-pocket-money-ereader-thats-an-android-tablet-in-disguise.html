@Title:Nook The Pocket Money EReader Thats An Android Tablet In Disguise

Nook - The Hackable eInk Android tablet just dropped to &pound;30.  [Barnes and Noble have dropped the price of its Nook eReader "for a limited time" in the UK.](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/05/01/barnes_and_nobles_slashes_nook_prices/)


Now cheaper than a Raspberry Pi, the Nook is not just a solid eReader - it is also eminently hackable. Under the hood the Nook is an eInk Android Tablet, the Barnes and Noble software running on top. In just a few steps, you can turn this ?30 eReader into a device that can read books from Barnes and Noble, Amazon, and Google Play, as well as run lightweight Android apps for email, Twitter, and web browsing.

Whilst there are lots of cheap Android tablets on the market, the eInk display is what sets the Nook apart. Easier to read in a variety of lighting conditions and with long battery life, a hacked Nook could be the ideal holiday partner. Plus, if you lose it, you're only ?30 down.

Lifehacker recently published an article on [how to turn the Nook SimpleTouch into an Android tablet](http://lifehacker.com/5889158/turn-a-99-nook-into-a-fully-fledged-android-tablet-in-four-easy-steps), which is a great place to start.
