@Title:Dropbox Doesnt Like Symlinks

# Dropbox doesn't like symlinks


Perhaps it is because I use Dropbox on both Windows and Linux, but there seems to be a problem with symlinks.

I like to use symlinks to re-use code libraries without having multiple copies on my machine. [Changing the PHP include path](http://php.net/manual/en/function.set-include-path.php) is another way to do this, but is less portable and doesn't cope with alternative versions as well. It is also "hidden" in the code, whereas a symlink is completely visible at directory/filesystem level.

However, if you symlink a directory from inside Dropbox then Dropbox seems to convert it to a copy of the real files at some point in the sychronisation process. This is different to Git, as an example, which can commit a symlink as a simple text file.

Just wondering if anyone else has had this same problem and if there is a workaround for it? In the short term, I have just moved my code out of Dropbox and over into my Github directory.
