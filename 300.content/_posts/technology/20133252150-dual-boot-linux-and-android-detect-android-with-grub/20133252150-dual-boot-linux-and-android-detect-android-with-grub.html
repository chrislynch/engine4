@Title:Dual Boot Linux And Android Detect Android With GRUB

You may have read my previous post about [why your netbook should run Android](). If there is one OS that I would put alongside Android on my netbook, it would be Linux - Linux Mint to be precise. There are some tasks where switching easily between one application and another are vital and some things that just aren't possible (yet) on Android - like running and developing on a LAMP stack.


Today, I installed Linux Mint. It spotted an old Ubuntu install (that I had all but forgotten that I had) but it didn't detect Android. As it turns out, GRUB can't detect Android and so getting your Android install to boot again after you have installed Linux is a fiddly business.

## How to break it.

1. Install Android x86 and let it install GRUB
2. Install Linux Mint and let it install GRUB too, squashing the previous GRUB beneath its minty heel
3. Reboot
4. Huzzah for Mint, but weep for lost Android.

## How to fix it.

### Get a GUI for GRUB

Before you do anything else, install the excellent **grub-customizer**. You won't find this in the Debian, Ubuntu, or Mint repositories, so add the repository yourself.

    sudo apt-add-repository ppa:danielrichter2007/grub-customizer 
    sudo apt-get update 
    sudo apt-get install grub-customizer

I simply don't edit GRUB configs often enough to even care where they are, especially as this seems to change all the time. Use **grub-customizer** to get around this - it will find your GRUB and let you change the configuration visually. At least, a *little* visually. You are still going to need to write those messy GRUB commands... or are you?

### Go and steal the GRUB config you need

Work out which partition Android is installed on. You can do this by running `gparted` and looking at the partitions or by running `fdisk -l` as root at the command line. Mine is on `/dev/sda1`.

Next, mount the Android partition.

Jump to the command line, and find your way to the `grub` directory off the root of the mounted Android partition. Mine was `/media/chris/Androidx86/grub`. In this directory is a file called `grub.lst`. Open this file and copy the contents.

### Use your stolen/recycled GRUB config

Run **grub-customizer** and use it to create a new GRUB entry.

Edit this entry, starting with a new line that reads `set_root='hd0,X` where X is the number of the partition where Android can be found. Mine was on `dev/sda1`, so my set_root is `set_root='hd0,1`.

Next, paste in the two lines from the copied config for Android x86 that *look like this* (yours will be different, maybe):

    linux /android-2011-08-15/kernel quiet root=/dev/ram0 \androidboot_hardware=eeepc \ acpi_sleep=s3_bios,s3_mode \ video=-16 DPI=160 SRC=/android-2011-08-15
    initrd /android-2011-08-15/initrd.img

Save the entry. This will take a couple of seconds as your GRUB config will now be reloaded.

### Reboot and Rejoice

Reboot and you should have the option for Android x86 back in your bootloader.

## Why not just install Android x86 second?

Just as Linux GRUB didn't want to detect Android, the Android GRUB bootloader won't spot Linux. The *latest version* can spot Windows, but that's it. My recommendation, if you are doing a ground-upwards build, is to **install Android first**, then install Linux, then use these instructions to fix GRUB.
