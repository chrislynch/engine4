@Title:Bubble Version 0.65 released!

Bubble 0.65 is now available. This release includes two important new features:


## Cover Pages

A number of users have requested that Bubble be able to add a cover page to their script. Cover pages typically hold the title of the story and contact details for the writer. Obviously you can copy and paste your Bubble script into a WYSIWYG editor (such as Word) to add one of these, but why should you have to? As of Version 0.65 any text found ***before*** the first page marker (e.g. the first #) will be treated as content for the cover page.

By default, cover pages are centre aligned vertically and horizontally and use a large font. The recommended approach is to put your title (and if necessary issue number) first, then your contact details, e.g.

In a future version I will add in some stats for the cover pages, such as number of pages in the script. And, speaking of pages...

## Page Breaks

I've also had feedback that there should be a page break at the end of each page, to make the script more readable. These are now on *by default*, but will only appear if you print the script from within your browser. The default HTML view is unaffected.

Look forward, as always, to your feedback!
