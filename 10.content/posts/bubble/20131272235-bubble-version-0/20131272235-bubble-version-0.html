@Title:Bubble Version 0

A few days ago I proposed a plain-text markup syntax for comic book scripts.


Since then I've been playing around with the format, writing some new scripts with it and converting some of my own scripts and some samples I had to hand into the language.

Fortunately for me there are already some great examples out there of how to do this sort of thing, so the syntax has come together quickly. Today I completed Version Zero of a PHP implementation of the code that [converts the plain text into comic book formatted script](pages/bubble), and have posted it up for people to try out today.

I've named the language ["Bubble"](pages/bubble), which is shorter than typing "A Plain Text Markup Language for Comic Book Scripts" over and over again. 

I'd really appreciate any feedback anyone can offer on the language and would love to hear from anyone who starts using it.
