@Title:Bubble Desktop 0.1 Released

Today I have released the *long awaited* desktop incarnation of Bubble, my plain text markup for comic books and its associated software to create industry standard scripts.


Moving to the desktop means that people (at least *Windows* people) can convert their plain text Bubble scripts without having to go to the online app and also means that anyone worried about jumping onboard with Bubble in case the software stops being hosted can now get involved.

This version is **just** a convertor and represents the tip of the iceberg for what I think Bubble on the desktop can be.

## Will future versions be platform independent?

**Yes.** I will confess to a little bit of "rush to market" having promised a desktop version of the software some weeks back, but is the first and only release that will be just for Windows.

## Is it still free?

**Yes**. Bubble is, and will always be, free software.
