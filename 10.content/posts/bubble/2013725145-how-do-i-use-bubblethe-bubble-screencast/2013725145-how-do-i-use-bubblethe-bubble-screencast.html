@Title:How do I use Bubble/The Bubble Screencast

Since creating [Bubble](/bubble), I've always used it to write my scripts. Bubble grew out of my needs for a portable, plain text comic book script editor after all and it would be *strange* for me to drop it in favour of Celtx or something else now. If and when I find things that it can't do, or doesn't do *well*, that's when I change the software. Bubble has also proved to be a good luck charm for me - everything I've even written in Bubble has been successfully submitted to an anthology or a publisher. If that's not a good reason to use, then I can't think of one (except of it's awesome features, that it's Free and Open Source Software, etc.)


Getting the most out of Bubble is about more than just learning the syntax though - it's about understanding how to use it the different stages of your writing process in a way that helps you and makes things faster and easier. I originally started to write an article documenting my Bubble script writing process, but decided a video was going to be much easier and more entertaining (especially as you get to hear me stumble at least once).
