@Title:Huge Mystery Eyeball Washes Up On Beach

		   #Huge Mystery Eyeball Washes Up On Beach#
Sky News are reporting that a <a href="http://news.sky.com/story/996724/huge-mystery-eyeball-washes-up-on-beach">huge and mysterious eyeball has washed up on a beach in Florida.</a>

Marine officials have said that the eyeball most likely came from a "squid, whale, or some type of large fish". All of which is deeply reassuring and proves they are on top of their game.

Personally, I am expecting either Starro or Cthulhu to come looking for that eye pretty soon, so the happy denizens of Florida had better watch out!
