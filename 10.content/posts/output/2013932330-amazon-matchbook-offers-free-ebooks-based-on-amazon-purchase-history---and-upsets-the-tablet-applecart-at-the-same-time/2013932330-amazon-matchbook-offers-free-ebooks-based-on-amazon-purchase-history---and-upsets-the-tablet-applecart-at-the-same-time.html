@Title:Amazon Matchbook offers free eBooks based on Amazon purchase history - and upsets the tablet applecart at the same time

		   How many books have you bought via Amazon? Whether the number is 10 or 10,000, you may be entitled to a cheap (or even free) eBook version via Amazon's new service **Matchbook**.

The words-on-paper equivalent to Amazon's *AutoRip* service, which gives you a [free MP3 version of any CD purchase made since 1998](http://www.engadget.com/2013/01/10/amazon-autorip-free-digital-versions/), Amazon have selected an initial crop of 10,000 eBooks to offer at prices between $2.99 and **$0.00**.

If you've got book shelves fitted to the rafters and don't mind replacing your printed matter with digital equivalents, Matchbook could be for you. At the very least, the gratis eBooks are worth downloading. It is also worth remembering that Amazon are looking at *your* buying history so any gifts you bought via Amazon, and even any books that you've since given away, are fair game.

This story is just a bit bigger than clearing shelf space though. Ask yourself...

## Why are Amazon doing this?

Amazon are competing with Google, Apple, and Microsoft for control of the digital products space right now.

Apps, games, eBooks, music, and movies are all available from the "App Stores" of all four players in this game.

All four players make hardware and have strong, established brands. All four have an "App Store" and a legion of loyal users. 

Amazon are in a slightly weakened position, however, because their Amazon Kindle Fire tablet is based on Google's Android Operating System. A bootstrap for their development process, but a potential risk if their long term plan is to become the one-stop digital shop for their existing customers. Amazon's App Store has been [criticised for being a severely cut down version of the full Google Experience](http://www.makeuseof.com/tag/google-play-vs-amazon-appstore-which-is-better-si/) and with Amazon's Kindle software available for all Android devices, it begs the question of why you would buy a Kindle Fire instead of an Android Tablet.

The answer, I think, is simple...

## The Kindle Fire isn't an Android Tablet, it's an "eReader Plus"

The Kindle Fire sits comfortably alongside the regular Kindle, the Barnes and Noble Nook, the Kobo and other eBook readers in a large bookstore. It's *not* sold as a tablet, more as a "media consumption device". It has books, and lots of them, but it also has music, and movies, and games, and social media and the internet...

And *now*, it just might have the best free eBook selection on the planet, depending on who (and what) made that initial cut of 10,000 eBooks.

Under the hood it might be a tablet, and Amazon might even want you to think of it as a tablet, but Kindle is to eReader as Hoover is to vacuum cleaner and that's inescapable.

It's also not a problem, because a lot of people only want to tablet for exactly the things that the Kindle Fire does. And that's where point two comes in...

## Amazon do something that Google, Apple, and Microsoft don't - they sell real stuff

Working in eCommerce, references to Amazon are commonplace. It is the received wisdom that *everyone* has shopped on Amazon and it many eCommerce consultants go-to place for best practice examples. I'm not saying that that is *right*, but it happens.

The point is that whilst Amazon may be fighting with three other titans for ubiquity and control of the digital marketplace right now, it is already dominant in the world of selling real, tangible things to people. And those real, tangible things... include books.

By launching MatchBook with the option to go all the way back into the dim and distant past of your purchasing history, Amazon are making the Kindle *as an eReader* a no-brainer. If you've shopped on Amazon in the past (and the received wisdom insists that you *have*) then buying a Kindle becomes an extension of that existing relationship.

Every CD you already bought ... yours digitally.
Every book (eventually, probably) you already bought ... also yours digitally.

By leveraging their position as the dominant seller of things, Amazon just might be able to steal market share from Google, Apple, and Microsoft and set themselves up as the de-facto provider of digital *and real world* entertainment.

And, if this trend continues, expect Amazon to be tying up some digital distribution deals soon that will allow you to stream your old movie collection. Assuming, of course, you get your DVDs from Amazon.

You ***do*** get your DVDs from Amazon, right?
