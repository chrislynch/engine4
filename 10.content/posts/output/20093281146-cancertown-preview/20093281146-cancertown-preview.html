@Title:Cancertown Preview

		   #Cancertown Preview#
I've just read the online preview of <a href="http://www.cancertown.co.uk">Cy Dethan's Cancertown</a> from Insomnia, and must say it looks like a very interesting read.

Cy describes the story as "Chinatown meets The Wizard of Oz, and he should know, but I get more of a feel of "Neverwhere meets Angelheart". Whatever the mix, you can't go wrong with those sorts of ingredients.

Bryan Talbot says "Cancertown will disorientate you, suck you in, chew you up and spit you out and you might well be in need of a change of underwear by the end."

I say "Check out the <a href="http://www.myebook.com/index.php?option=ebook&amp;id=1314">Myebook - Cancertown</a> preview and prepare to be impressed".
