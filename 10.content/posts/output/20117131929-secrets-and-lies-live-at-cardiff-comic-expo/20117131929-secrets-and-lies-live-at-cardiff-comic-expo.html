@Title:Secrets And Lies Live At Cardiff Comic Expo

		   #Secrets And Lies Live At Cardiff Comic Expo#
A little late posting this up, but where else would you get the chance to see me accidentally get tongue-tied and say "wank" at <a title="Paul Cornell's website" href="http://www.paulcornell.com">Paul Cornell</a>, or <a title="Charlie Adlard" href="http://www.charlieadlard.com">Charlie Adlard</a> get a question wrong ... about <em>himself</em>?

Hosted by the inimitable <a href="http://www.sidekickcomicsuk.com">Sidekick Cast</a>, I present ... Secrets and Lies Live at the Cardiff Comic Expo 2011.

I had great fun doing this panel. It was great to mix with such a fantastic group of creators and Dan and Bones were on top form as hosts. If you watch nothing else, watch Dan "work the room" early in Part 1 of 3. If he doesn't have a future as a cult leader, I'll drink the Kool-Aid.
