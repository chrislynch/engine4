#Orang Utan Comics And Monkeys With Machineguns Round Table (Comic Book Outsiders Episode 46)#

The last, I think, of our podcast appearances from the Bristol Con 2009 is featured in <a href="http://comicbookoutsiders.wordpress.com/2009/05/14/comic-book-outsiders-episode-46-bristol-special/">Comic Book Outsiders Episode 46.</a>

Chaired by Scott, from <a href="http://comicbookoutsiders.wordpress.com/">Comic Book Outsiders</a>, the <a href="http://www.orangutancomics.co.uk/">Orang Utan</a> panel metamorphosed in a round table discussion on indie comics that also features Stu and I, and the guys from Geek Syndicate.

It's somewhere in the region of 45 minutes of unplanned, unscripted, but hopefully insightful and amusing banter between the two studios as we share war stories from the world of small press comics.

Particularly worth listening out for are the moment where I blantantly repeat myself and then shamlessly deny it, and the moment that Pete Rogers confesses that the biggest hurdle Orang Utan Comics face is Monkeys with Machineguns ;-).

<em>For the benefit of the tape</em>, I think he just means that we're both tall.

Many thanks to Scott for chairing the panel and special thanks to <a href="http://www.orangutancomics.co.uk/creators/writers/peterrogers.html">Peter Rogers</a> and <a href="http://www.orangutancomics.co.uk/creators/writers/iansharman.html">Ian Sharman</a> for sharing their panel with us ... absolute gentlemen as always.
