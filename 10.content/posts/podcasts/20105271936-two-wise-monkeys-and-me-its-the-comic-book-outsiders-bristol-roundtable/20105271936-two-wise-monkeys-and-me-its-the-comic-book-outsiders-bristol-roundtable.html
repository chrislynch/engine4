#Two Wise Monkeys And Me: It's The Comic Book Outsiders Bristol Roundtable!#

Last year the Bristol Comic Expo played host to a round table discussion between the twin publishing mights of <a href="http://www.monkeyswithmachineguns.com">Monkeys with Machineguns</a> and <a href="http://www.orangutancomics.co.uk/">Orang Utan comics</a>, the <a href="http://geeksyndicate.wordpress.com/">crew from Geek Syndicate</a>, and some <a href="http://twitter.com/derekjhartley/">hardcore</a> <a href="http://twitter.com/thislloyd">comic fans</a>, all masterfully hosted and chaired by the <a href="http://www.uea.ac.uk/cmp/People/Faculty/Dr.+Scott+Grandison">erudite genius</a> <a href="http://comicbookoutsiders.libsyn.com/">Scott Grandison</a>. <a href="http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/2009/05/14/orang-utan-comics-and-monkeys-with-machineguns-round-table-comic-book-outsiders-episode-46/">The result became Comic Book Outsiders Episode 46.</a>

This year, the round table took a more formal ... form, and found itself on the official schedule for the Small Press Expo in the Mercure Hotel.

With another year behind all of us, <a href="http://twitter.com/PeteRogers">Peter Rogers</a>, <a href="http://www.twitter.com/idsharman">Ian Sharman</a>, and myself all took to the floor to talk about our experiences as both publishers and creators, how we got started in the industry, and where we think we are going next. The differing approaches taken by our respective publishing houses/studios hopefully made for an interesting and thought provoking panel.

If not, you will get to hear me
<ol>
	<li>Stretch a one beat joke about a table cloth way beyond its sell by date</li>
	<li>Somehow pull off a callback to a previous joke at the end of the panel</li>
	<li>Accuse Ian Sharman of "Saying no, but meaning yes"</li>
	<li>Accuse Peter Rogers of looking like Lynne Faulds Wood</li>
	<li>Accuse Peter Rogers of being Jessica Fletcher from Murder She Wrote</li>
</ol>
The topic of digital comics also features heavily, and I do my best to deliver <a href="http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/2010/05/14/can-there-be-an-open-format-for-digital-comics-micah-baldwin-thinks-so/">an impassioned plea on behalf of those who like to share comics</a>. I'll have to listen back to see if I got my point across or not.
