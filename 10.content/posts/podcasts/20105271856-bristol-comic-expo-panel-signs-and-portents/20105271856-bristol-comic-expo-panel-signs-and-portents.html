#Bristol Comic Expo Panel: Signs And Portents#

The audio recording of my Bristol Comic Expo panel, <a href="http://www.sidekickcomicsuk.com/blogs/blog5.php/2010/05/26/sidekickcast-episode-41-signs-and-porten-2010">"<strong>Signs and Portents</strong>", is now available from the Sidekick Cast website</a>, iTunes, and anywhere where good podcasts can be found.

Before I write anything about this panel, I want to send out a huge thanks to both the boys from Sidekick Cast and to everyone who turned up to make the panel a success. We had some great questions, an <em>incredible</em> game of Secrets and Lies, and the whole process was made significantly less nerve racking and markedly more awesome by having a room full of friendly faces.

<strong>Gushing over.</strong>

If you missed the panel, other than a potted history of The Dark and MWM, some shameless plugging (including a new personal best for me), and some light hearted ribbing of a certain <a href="http://stuartt1975.wordpress.com/"><em>missing monkey</em></a>, you probably missed me talking about codes, fiction, stories inside stories, fringe science, how thinly read I <em>really am</em>, and trying to answer some questions from people who had clearly thought about them beforehand. The swines. (Barry Nugent, I'm looking at you).

We had a lot of positive feedback about the panel throughout the show, so if you did miss it and would like to catch up, <a href="http://www.sidekickcomicsuk.com/blogs/blog5.php/2010/05/26/sidekickcast-episode-41-signs-and-porten-2010">download the "Signs and Portents" podcast today</a>.
