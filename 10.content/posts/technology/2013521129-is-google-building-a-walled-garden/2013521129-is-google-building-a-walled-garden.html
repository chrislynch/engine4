@Title:Is Google Building A Walled Garden?

Google have developed a habit of closing down open protocols and replacing them proprietary or closed applications.


Google Reader, the powerful RSS reader, has been killed off. The replacement? Reading your "news" in Google+.

CalDAV support was dropped from Google Calendar, disconnecting the app from third party applications.

Now, Google have dropped XMPP from Google Talk, disconnecting third party apps such as Pidgin. XMPP has been part of Google Talk for over a decade and was also the protocol that underpinned the ill-fated Google Wave project.

Are Google building a wall around their services, abandoning open protocols in favour of closed systems and/or APIs that require you to have a Google Account? I certainly looks like it, or maybe they just like burning down their house and starting over...

Whatever the reason, this volatility in the Google App stack is something that technologists need to keep an eye on. If you're considering moving your business to Google Apps, you need to consider whether any of the apps that could be on Google's hit list in the future are "must haves" for your organisation.
