#Apple Decrees Spotify Worthy Of IPhone#

I've become somewhat obsessed with Apple's App Store approval process over the last few weeks, impatiently waiting for Issue 1 of The Dark to be released.

A little while back I blogged about the phenomenal interest that had been generated by the submission of a Spotify App to the store. Well, in the journalistic style, there is an update.

The breaking news today? <a href="http://www.theregister.co.uk/2009/08/27/spotify_on_iphone/">Apple decrees Spotify worthy of iPhone • The Register</a>.

Phonophiles and eclectic music lovers like me may rejoice.

Now all we need is a really good sci-fi comic book series on there ...
