@Title:Feedly offers "Pro" Version of its Newsreader, shows Google how it could have been done

Feedly are now offering **Feedly Pro**, a $45/year upgrade to the standard (free) Feedly product. The upgrade gets you:


1. The ability to search your articles
1. One click save of articles across to Evernote
1. One click save to Pocket
1. Premium Support

Depending on how you use Feedly this feature set might seem a little thin, but only time will tell how many users sign up and how quickly.

If this is a success, [Google may regret putting Google Reader out to pasture in favour of Google+](technology/feedly-to-replace-google-reader) although it is easy to imagine Google taking some flack if they had taken "Reader" pro. As I blogged recently, [users increasingly except all Google services to be free](technology/why-ads-in-google-mail-dont-matter-or-how-i-learnt-to-stop-worrying-and-love-gmail), and this may prove to be a real obstacle for the search giant in the future.

For now, Feedly remains the darling of the news reader space. To boost capital prior to the launch of Feedly Pro to the general public, it ran a short lived campaign to sell 5000 $99 lifetime licenses. They sold out in just **eight hours**.
