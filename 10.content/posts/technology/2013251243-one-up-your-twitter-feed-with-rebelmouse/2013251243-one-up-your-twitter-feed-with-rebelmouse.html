@Title:One Up Your Twitter Feed With Rebelmouse

RebelMouse is a web application that turns your social stream of Twitter, Facebook, Google+ and more into a Pinterest style grid of headlines and images, focussing on the posts that contain graphics and links.


Exceptionally easy to setup, the results really are impressive. I've yet to delve into the themeatic settings, configuration options, or post filtering and I'm already hooked. As well as pulling your own content through, you can also follow other users and follow specific hashtags.

In some ways the results are similar to paper.li, but more engaging from a design perspective and more personal to you.

Best of all, there is a handy embed mode that allows you to put the RebelMouse grid inside your own website. I've added my RebelMouse feed to the right sidebar of this site. This is the real "level up" of RebelMouse - finally bringing an alternative to the turgid text-only lists of posts that adorn most websites and blogs today.
