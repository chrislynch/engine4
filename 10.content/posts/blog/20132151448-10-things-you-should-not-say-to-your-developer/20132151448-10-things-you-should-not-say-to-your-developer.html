@Title:10 Things You Should Not Say To Your Developer

It's an old adage but, before you next speak to your developer, try to imagine that you are talking to your plumber and that your toilet is leaking hellish amounts of human poo(1) all over your floor. If you wouldn't say it to your plumber, I would suggest that you don't want to say it to your developer either.


Still not sure? Here's my **Top 10 things not to say to a developer**.

1. It's only moving some stuff around
1. How can it take that long?
1. I can get a student to do this...
1. Can't you just copy and paste it from Amazon?
1. This is really urgent for us, we've tried to work around it but can't, so can you do it **now**
1. It's really simple
1. If you give me the code, I could probably do it myself
1. My son/daughter/nephew can do this in his/her bedroom
1. We really need this, but we don't want to pay for it

**1** Human poo is confirmed by [Wes Packer](http://www.wespacker.com/) as being the worst form of poo.
