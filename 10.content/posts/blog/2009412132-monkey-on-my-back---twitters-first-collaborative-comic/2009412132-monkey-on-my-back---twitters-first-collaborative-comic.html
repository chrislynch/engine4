@Title:Monkey On My Back   Twitters First Collaborative Comic

#Monkey On My Back - Twitter's First Collaborative Comic?#

The guys at <a href="http://monkeyonmyback.squarespace.com/twitter-comic/">Monkey On My Back</a> are running an interesting experiment. Can the <em>almost</em> infinite monkeys of <a href="http://www.twitter.com">Twitter</a> create anything near to the works of Shakespeare, or are we all about to SMS ourselves up in flames?

The gambit is simple - start a story, then have people tweet in the next line. Pick the one you like, retweet it, draw a comic book panel for it, then wait for more tweets to come in. Rinse and repeat until story done.

I've tossed my hat into the ring, although with my track record of killing "comic jams" dead with my overuse of the word "betwixt" (long story, for another post), who knows if I will get to be one of the monkeys in question?
