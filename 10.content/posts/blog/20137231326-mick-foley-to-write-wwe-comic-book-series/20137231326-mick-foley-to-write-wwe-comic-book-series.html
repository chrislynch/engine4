@Title:Mick Foley to write WWE Comic Book Series

I saw Mick Foley on one of his speaking tours in Cardiff's Glee Club. Mick is one of my favourite all time wrestlers, a truly great entertainer who risked his health for our entertainment and joy. After seeing him on stage that night, I also realised that Mick Foley is an incredible story teller. Captivating, gentle, and somewhat magical, Foley told stories of the testosterone fuelled world of professional wrestling with a sense of whimsy and the fantastic that was transportative. In short, the guy knows how to weave a tale. He also *loves* wrestling. You can't fake that kind of passion.


Mick Foley is no stranger to writing, of course. He's a New York Times Best-selling Writer and has written memoirs, fiction, and children's books. I haven't read a comic with a wrestler in it since the days of Hulk Hogan, but you can count me in for this one.

Now all we need to do is get a petition up for [Simon "Soulman" Williams](http://soulman-inc.deviantart.com/) to get the gig illustrating these.

Bang Bang!
