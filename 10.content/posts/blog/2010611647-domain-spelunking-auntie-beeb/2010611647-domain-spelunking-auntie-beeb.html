#Domain Spelunking Auntie Beeb#

<strong><a href="http://www.whatdotheyknow.com/request/domain_names#incoming-86647">A recent Freedom of Information request has unearthed a sizeable number of domain names owned by the BBC</a>.</strong>

Whilst some are territory related, there are a number of interesting ones relating to specific TV series. I've never been good an unearthing this kind of back matter, although I'm always intrigued when I do find it. My current favourites are <a href="http://www.unit.org.uk">http://www.unit.org.uk</a>, which has some interesting UNIT activity relating to the Chris Ecclestone era Doctor Who, and <a href="http://jellyparties.co.uk/">http://jellyparties.co.uk/</a>, which is the truly terrifying website of Psychoville's Mr. Jelly.

Most of the sites don't look like they have taken a lot of time to set up, although I suspect the awful state of Mr. Jelly's is the work of many hours for an ingenious designer. Perhaps I should make an FOI request myself as to how much time these sites take, and how many other people have found them before now?
