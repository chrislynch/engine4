Check out this incredible video! Half way through I was starting to think "this looks good, but I can get a toy repulsor and cut it to fit, what's the big deal?".

*Then?* This guys starts firing lasers and popping balloons like cans in an old West shooting gallery. OK, so they are *only* balloons, but it is still cool.

Kudos to the guy who made this - all I need now is to find someone who can encase a Google Glass display in an Iron Man helmet...
