Rick's artwork looks fantastic. I can't show you much without giving away some of the story, but here is sample that hopefully showcases Rick's talent and gives a few hints as what you can expect from the story.

And of course, I'm only going to hint the "The Escape Artist" is not entirely what it seems ...
