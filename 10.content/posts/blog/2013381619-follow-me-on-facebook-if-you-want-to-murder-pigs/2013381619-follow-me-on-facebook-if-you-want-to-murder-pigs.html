@Title:Follow Me On Facebook If You Want To Murder Pigs

People of Suffolk unite, the vegans are on the march. Or, at least, the vegans are sending rude emails to a school that has had the audacity to suggest that children should know that a sausage is made out of parts of a dead pig. Quite what Liza Moore and the rest of the Colchester Animal Defenders make of Turkey Twizzlers is anybody's guess.


Now, you might think this blog post is going to be a bit of rant about those pesky vegans. Sadly, it's not. Putting aside whether anyone said something rude to someone else, in the playground or out of it, they are entitled to their view. Of course they are. They are entitled to voice it and the school, as a public institution, should pay attention to it and take it into consideration. 

What I do think is a bit of problem here though, is **petition websites**.

The petition in question can be found on the [Care 2 Petition](http://www.thepetitionsite.com/701/506/479/request-that-peasenhall-primary-school-reconsider-raising-and-killing-three-piglets/) website. Take a look at it, and see if you can see what I can see. Ignore the rhetoric from the petition organisers - a petition is, at its fundament, a one sided argument. Instead, look at who has *signed up*.

I can see a lot of people who have signed this petition from overseas. Japan, Hungary, Spain. I can see a lot people who signed, but did not bother to say *why*. Is it a technological wonder that people can express their opinion on a topic globally, or is it just the case that signing a petition on *any* topic is now as easy as clicking "like" on Facebook?

### I click like on Facebook a lot, but I can tell you this ... I really don't care if that cat gets a cheeseburger or not. ###

The [UK Government's own e-petetion site requires that you are a UK resident to sign a petition](http://epetitions.direct.gov.uk/terms-and-conditions), but a great many of the other petition websites have no such restrictions. Is this indicative of a "global culture", is it ignorant of the significantly different cultures that exist geographically, or is it just lazy coding? Worse, it is not lazy at all, but very carefully considered, a deliberate attempt to create viral content and build website traffic by imposing no restrictions - no matter how much they might invalidate the content of the petition itself?

Maybe, maybe not. But here's the bigger question... **is morality absolute, or localised?** Is what is acceptable, even "right", in one place not the same in another? At what point should our respect for another person's culture, religion, or viewpoint be overidden by a more fundamental understanding of what is right and wrong - and is this even something that we all share?

### Online petitions encourage a sort of "moral spam" ###

I have no idea what the answers to these questions are and nor, do I suspect, do the people running these "pop-up" petition websites. Whilst, in my mind, there is no doubt that organisations such as Greenpeace use online petitioning and social media very well on a global scale to tackle global issues, the question of whether one school in Suffolk tells kids where sausages come from is in a whole different (and much smaller) league. Whether you agree with the stance or note, those thousands of signatures start to very shakey all of a sudden and the cause, right or wrong, is done no favours by the "moralistic spamming" of easy petition signing.

Here's my take on it. If the website you are going to use to run your petition also has a [Vice President of Sales](http://www.care2.com/aboutus/advertise.html) then perhaps you are in the wrong place. There are lots of good websites fighting for change, but **petition websites are not here to save us** - the sooner we wise up, the better a tool for the important fights these websites will be.
