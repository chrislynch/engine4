#Monkeys With Machineguns Adopt Lucky#

Monkeys with Machineguns are supporting the Born Free <a href="http://www.adoptamonkey.co.uk">Adopt A Monkey</a> campaign and have just, through a concerted cereal eating campaign, adopted <strong>Lucky</strong>.
<blockquote>Lucky was found in a town close to Lake Malawi. Passers-by saw him tied to a tree in a market in the centre of a rubbish pit and called the sanctuary. Even though he was well fed, he had not been looked after properly. The rope and chain that tied him to the tree was too tight and dug into his skin. The team took him straight to the sanctuary, freed him from his rope and chains and within weeks, his injuries healed.

After four weeks in quarantine, Lucky joined Buddy's troop.

Soon, he'll be joining a new family which will be released into the wild in November 2009.</blockquote>
This is a fantastic and very worthwhile campaign - all you have to do is keep eating cereal and posting the codes online to continue to adopt monkeys.

Once you have registered your codes, you can download a large picture of your chosen monkey and a PDF of an adoption certificate.
