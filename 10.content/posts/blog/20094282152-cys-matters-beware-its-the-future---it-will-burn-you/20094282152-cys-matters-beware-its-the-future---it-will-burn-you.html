#Cy's Matters: Beware! It's The Future - It Will Burn You!#

Cy Dethan is a man with his finger on the pulse so when he says "<a href="http://theraggedman.blogspot.com/2009/04/beware-its-future-it-will-burn-you.html">Beware! It's the Future - It Will Burn You!</a>", I have to prick up my ears (or, as this the internet my eyes) and listen (read).

What Cy's posting about is the publication of some Markosia back catalogue stuff via iTunes as an iPhone application and the future publication of the same to Google Android phones, Blackberrys etc. in the near future. Very exciting stuff, especially when you get your head around the size of this market place and how accessible the content becomes when it this these platforms.

I had intended to download Beowulf #1 as a trail and tell you how good it was but, sadly, I can't. I do not own an iPhone or an iPod. I own a Nokia 5800, which is technically far superior, sexier, does more, but lacks access to iPhone applications. When iPhone applications where just glorified web pages and calculators for working out your share of a bill, I didn't care. But now the iPhone has comics, and thusly I am <em>vexed</em>. I also maybe have to rethink my comments about accessibility, but that's a job for another time.

So, no free content for me. Until I buy an iPod Touch, I guess.
