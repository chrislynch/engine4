#New Portfolio Available Via My EBook#

I have collated a set of my most recent comic book portfolio pieces in an online eBook.

You can <a href="http://www.myebook.com/index.php?option=ebook&amp;id=910">access my new portfolio through this link</a> or click on the "Launch eBook" image on the front page.

Flash is required, but as a mechanism for delivering high resolution pages (absolutely essential for a comic portfolio, even as a writer) My eBook looks pretty hard to beat. My new portfolio includes artwork from the immensely talented Stu.Art, Christian Ward, and Mark Smith.
