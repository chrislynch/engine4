@Title:The Gunslingers Ghost

#The Gunslinger's Ghost#

It had started in the West. And that was fair enough, because that was what everyone said the West was all about. America, the land of opportunity. The land of fresh starts. The place where anything could happen.

And it did.

It had started when Jacob had rode into the wrong town with his little family on the cart behind him. He wasn't much of a map reader but, swept up in the gold rush and eager to stake his claim, he'd loaded them all onto a small cart and headed West. He had hoped to hitch up to one of the big wagon trains, then break away from them when the time was right. Find a good spot, near a good town. Somewhere for the kids to get schooled, so they wouldn't end up chasing dreams across the country like their old man, somewhere for his wife to buy fine dresses with all the money his claim would earn them. Church on a Sunday, singing praises to high heaven, a good respectable man with a good respectable family.

But Jacob didn't find his wagon train. He didn't find the perfect little town he'd dreamed of. He found a place called Malady, and it was fair to say that the place found him.

Did it matter now? Maybe, maybe not. The town was gone. But Jacob was still wandering, and every town he blew into was another town just like Malady. A town just like the town that took his family.

"Jay? Are you coming down for breakfast?"

A woman's voice shook Jacob lose of his memories and back into the present day. The very present day. The calendar on the wall said the year as 2012. A long way from the days of the West, and a long way from Malady. 

"Sure, I'll ... er ... be right down."

Jacob checked his profile in the mirror. This body was fifteen or sixteen, he'd wager. A man, where Jacob came from, but little more than a child in this time. The six shooter was snug in the back of his denims, the loose shirt he was wearing giving it no outline. The six shooter was always there, wherever and whenever Jacob woke up. It was the constant, the steady point around which his world turned.

The gun was love.

Downstairs, a woman who Jacob guessed was his mother made pancakes. The food here sure beat a lot of the places he'd woken up, but a full belly didn't make the world right. It just ... slowed men down. Contentment was not a state of mind that Jacob could allow himself. Even as he ate the pancakes, feeling their warmth dull his hunger, his eyes picked apart the woman in front of him and found the monster underneath. She was the same, no better than any of the others. Her painted face, her clothes. Another one, like all the rest.

Jacob at the last mouthful of pancake and pulled the six shooter out from behind his back.

"This gun is love," he said, and shot his mother through the head.
