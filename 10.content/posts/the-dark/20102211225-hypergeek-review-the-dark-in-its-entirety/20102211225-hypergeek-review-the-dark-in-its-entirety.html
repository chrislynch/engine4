#Hypergeek Review The Dark In Its Entirety#

Ed Kaye followed up his review of Issue #1 of The Dark by giving us <a href="http://www.hypergeek.ca/2010/01/graphic-novel-review-the-dark-by-chris-lynch-rick-lundeen.html">his take on the whole story ...</a>
<blockquote>Not only has Chris Lynch created an incredibly interesting concept to use as the basis of this story, but he's also created an incredibly unique plot ... Rick Lundeen's linework on this story has a very clean and smooth look to it, which is complimented by some really vibrant colouring ...

The Dark is a highly original and inventive graphic novel, with an intriguing and involving plot that really keeps readers on their toes. It's a book that you're going to want to read at least twice, trust me! Forty-Five was my early pick for graphic novel of the year, but it looks like it's already got some tough competition in the form of The Dark!</blockquote>
