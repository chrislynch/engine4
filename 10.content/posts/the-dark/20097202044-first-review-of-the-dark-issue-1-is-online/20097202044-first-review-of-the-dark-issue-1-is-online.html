#First Review Of The Dark, Issue 1 Is Online#

The guys over at Sidekick Cast are the first take to take advantage of our reviewer's preview, and have given The Dark four stars!
<blockquote>When I started the first issue I thought 'Ok this seems like your standard dark avenger vigilate superhero story with a nice little sci-fi premise for the powers'. I was wrong. The main protagonist reads like the bastard love child of Tony Stark and Bruce Wayne with a hint of the tortured soul of Frank Castle. The idea of information as a weapon is taken to it's literal conclusion in this story and although it may seem like the stuff of science fiction I suspect Lynch has been flicking through the pages of The New Scientist as liquid information is one of the next big steps in digital information transfer. This is very much on the fringe of science-fact.

By the end of the book everything I thought I knew had been turned on it's head and I was totally sucked in.</blockquote>
It's great to see the book already going down well, and hopefully people reading the review will be inspired to pick up that all important first issue.
