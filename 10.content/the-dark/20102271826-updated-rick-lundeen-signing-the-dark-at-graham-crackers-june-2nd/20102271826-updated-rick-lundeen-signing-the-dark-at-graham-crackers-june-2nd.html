<strong>This is an alternative date to the April 7th</strong><strong> date, owing to shipping issues with the books.
</strong>

This is a rare opportunity for fans of the book to meet up with the man who created the graphic novel's unique look and who gave life to its disturbing creations.

Best of luck to Rick for the signing!
