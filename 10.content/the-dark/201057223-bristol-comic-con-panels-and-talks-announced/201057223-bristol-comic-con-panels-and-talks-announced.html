#Bristol Comic Con Panels And Talks Announced#

Geek Syndicate have scooped us all yet again with this year's <a href="http://geeksyndicate.wordpress.com/2010/05/07/countdown-to-bristol-international-comic-small-press-expo-2010-%e2%80%93-day-7-%e2%80%98mercure-and-ramada-panel-timetables%e2%80%99/">Bristol Comic Con and Bristol Small Press Expo's Panels and Talks schedule</a>.

I am very fortunate this year to be appearing on two panels, one at 12:00 and another at 13:00 on Saturday.

At 12:00, I will be taking to the stage alongside Gavin and Dan from The Sidekick cast for a panel called "Signs and Portents", based loosely on my new graphic novel "The Dark". The official blurb is as follows:
<blockquote>What do William Blake, symbolic code breaking, aura reading, Byron, Howard Hughes, numerology, World War Two poetry, and cutting edge science all have in common?

Find out as Gavin Jones and Dan Marshall (of The Sidekick Cast) probe the mind of Markosia word smith Chris Lynch and find out about his latest projects, including the critically acclaimed sci-fi thriller "The Dark", available in a limited edition Expo Exclusive edition this weekend.</blockquote>
Then, at 13:00, I will be sitting down for a "fireside chat" with the Orang Utan Comics crew and the inimitable Scott Grandison for the "Comic Book Outsiders" panel ...
<blockquote>Orang Utan Comics and Monkeys With Machineguns are successful small press studios putting out high-quality content for the last five years. Join them as they discuss their experiences in the business so far, give advice to others looking to produce their own titles and their view of the future for small press and independent comics in a world where digital distribution is becoming increasingly important.

Hosted by Scott Grandison of the Comic Book Outsiders podcast.</blockquote>
I will be flying solo this year as Stu.Art, the taller and some say better looking half of MWM, isn't able to make it to Bristol this year. Still, I'm sure I'll hold my own!

I haven't been on a panel since the very first Birmingham Comic Show when I sat on the Horror Comics Panel. Anyone who was at that event might remember be likening the realistic horror of The Walking Dead to Frank Butcher turning up naked on Pat's doorstep in Eastenders. In context, I was talking about <em>"the horror of the real"</em> and how brilliantly I think Walking Dead portrays the reactions of the human survivors. I think Charlie Adlard is still avoiding me though.

If you want a sampler of the sort of nonsense that I try to pass off as intellectual discourse, even some kind of pseudo-science at a push, you can delve in to the archives of yesteryear with "<a href="2009/05/13/an-evening-with-monkeys-with-machineguns/">An Evening with Monkeys with Machineguns</a>" and my guest appearance on "<a href="2009/05/14/orang-utan-comics-and-monkeys-with-machineguns-round-table-comic-book-outsiders-episode-46/">The Orang Utan Comics Round Table</a>" from Bristol 2009.

I apologise in advance to all concerned.
