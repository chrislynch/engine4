The signing will run from 12:00 - 15:00, so hopefully I will have plenty of time to talk to everyone who comes in. Podcasters and bloggers are welcome to get in touch in advance to arrange interviews before, during, or after the session.

Other than for conventions, this is my first ever signing outside of good old Cardiff, so fingers crossed for a good event!
