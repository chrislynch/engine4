#First Shots Of The Dark On PSP#

The Dark went live on the Playstation Digital Comics network last week and my good friend <a href="http://www.frugalgaming.co.uk/">Lee </a>was kind enough to tweet me these shots of the comic up and running on his PSP!

I heard from Harry at Markosia that the book has been doing very well indeed in terms of downloads and the guys at Sony have tweeted me recently to say there has been a lot of positive fan feedback. Great news!

If you've got a PSP and you have downloaded the book, I'd love to know what you think.
