#The Dark : Signing In Waterstones, Cribbs Causeway, April 24th 1pm#

The good, good people of Waterstones will be letting me loose in their Cribbs Causeway store on April 24th at 1pm.

This is the first time I have signed in a "mainstream" book store as opposed to a specialist comic store or a convention; I'm really looking forward to introducing some non-comics fans to The Dark as well as meeting up with any comics fans who come by.
