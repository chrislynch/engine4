#The Dark: Signing At Forbidden Planet, Cardiff. April 8th, 5pm-6pm#

<a href="http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/forbiddenplanet.gif"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-1065" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-right: 20px;" title="forbiddenplanet" src="http://www.planetofthepenguins.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/02/forbiddenplanet-242x300.gif" alt="forbiddenplanet" width="242" height="300" /></a>It's that most vital of things ... the home town signing! Chris will be Forbidden Planet, Cardiff, from 5pm to 6pm to sign copies of The Dark. Terror abounds as I face friends and family in my "professional" capacity as the mind behind the book, so any and all support is greatly appreciated!

Many thanks to the guys at Forbidden Planet for squeezing this into their busy signings schedule. If you are interested, please sign up for our <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=328755030929">Facebook Event</a> so that they now how many people to expect. (Not that selling out in my home town would not be <em>cool</em>.)

For the hardcore, rumours abound of an  "after party" in one of Cardiff's many fine hostelries ... keep your ear to the ground for information on the night.
