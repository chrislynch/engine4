The excellent fellows of <strong><a href="http://www.sidekickcomicsuk.com/blogs/">SideKickCast</a></strong> have posted our unedited, unexpurgated, mildly humorous, and erratically rambling interview from Saturday Night in the Mercure Bar at Bristol Comic Expo 2009.

If you have the time, why not enjoy ...
