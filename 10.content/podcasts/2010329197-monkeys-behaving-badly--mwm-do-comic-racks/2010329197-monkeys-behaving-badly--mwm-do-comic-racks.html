After months, even years, of snubbing us in favour of unknowns like Paul Cornell and Tony Lee, Comic Racks have finally bitten the bullet and called down the thunder that is ... <a href="http://comicracks.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=596831"><strong>the Monkeys with Machineguns Interview</strong></a>.

Thrill ... as we talk about ourselves. Gasp ... as we find out about Iz's toilet habits. Be amazed ... at our choice of favourite biscuits. Shrug and say "I thought as much" ... when I call Stuart a "French Duke".

Sadly, despite our best efforts, Iz and Stace have salvaged an almost sensible sounding interview out of our tomfoolery. Listen for the outtakes though (after that Cornell guy again), where you get a true taste of the pain that Iz and Stace went through to bring you this interview.

Happy 50th guys ... you don't look a day over 45!
