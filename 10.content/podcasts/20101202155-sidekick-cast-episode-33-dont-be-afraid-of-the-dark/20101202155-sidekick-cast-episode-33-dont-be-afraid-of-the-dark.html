I had a fantastic time recording this with Bones and Dan, and I really think that comes through. These guys are always great value. Dan's done a cracking job of editing some sense into what was several hours of comic book related madness.

If you want to hear a very different take on The Dark to other's I've recorded, and also hear my head almost explode trying to crack this episode's <em>Secrets and Lies</em>, don't miss this episode of this always outstanding podcast.

The Sidekicks are also <a href="http://www.thecomicforums.com/forum2//index.php?showtopic=165085">running a competition to win a mug</a> featuring fantastic artwork by Rob Jackson and a cack-handed signature by me
