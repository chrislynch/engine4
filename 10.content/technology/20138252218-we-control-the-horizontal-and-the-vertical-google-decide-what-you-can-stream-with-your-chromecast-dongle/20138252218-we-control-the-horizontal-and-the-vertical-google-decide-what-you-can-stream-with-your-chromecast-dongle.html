@Title:"We Control the Horizontal and the Vertical": Google decide what you can stream with your Chromecast dongle

ChromeCast is Google's answer to AirPlay and Apple TV - a $35 dongle that lets you stream content direct from your Android device to your HDMI-equipped TV. Except, it doesn't *really* do that. As this article on The Verge explains, [ChromeCast streams from the Internet, not your device](http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/29/4566718/google-chromecast-review/in/4317181). So, media on your device is out of bounds until you've uploaded it to the cloud, and Google ***don't want it any other way***.


A less cynical minded person might see this just as a limitation of the current iteration of the ChromeCast device and accept that most user-generated content *is* accessible, you just have to upstream it to the cloud *first*. A less than ideal, less than perfect, solution but workable. Those of a more cynical bent however have criticised the device for working in this way, pointing out that ChromeCast support has to be *built into apps themselves* and this means, right now, ChromeCast is great if you like Chrome Browser, Netflix, or YouTube, but no use otherwise. So, those holiday photos you took on your phone? You won't be ChromeCast-ing those, at least not until you've uploaded them to a website so that you can download them again in Google Chrome. Humph.

This uneasy status quo was shattered by the release of an app called AllCast/AirCast on August 18th, an app developed by [Koushik Dutta](https://plus.google.com/110558071969009568835/posts/G3jF2JynLc2) that allowed you to stream locally stored video direct to your ChromeCast. As video is one of the bulkiest things to upstream and one of the things I can most readily imagine wanting to throw up onto a big screen shortly after recording it, this app bridged a vital gap in the ChromeCast's functionality in my opinion. There's been an enthusiastic response to the app too. Oh, except from Google...

The Verge reported today that the most recent update to the ChromeCast software has removed support for Dutta's application, once more slamming the door on your local video content and locking you into the Google Play/Netflix/YouTube trifecta. This knee-jerk, heavy handed approach, more similar to Apple's policing of the App Store, hasn't gone down well and has brought the openness of the Android platform into question once again. [Google say that they are actively looking for more ChromeCast partners at the moment](http://www.theverge.com/2013/7/25/4556978/can-chromecast-succeed-where-google-tv-failed) and maybe Dutta's app just hit a little too close for home for them right now, or opened the ChromeCast up to questions about copyright and pirated movies that are just a little uncomfortable.

The move is somewhat bizarre if it is targeted at prevent pirated media from being played through the ChromeCast as not only is YouTube already rife with questionable videos and music, but the Tab Casting feature of ChromeCast allows *any webpage content* to be streamed to the device. Perhaps the difference with AllCast/AirCast was that it didn't also tell Google what you were looking at. Or, maybe, Google have a solution of their own coming very soon. Whatever the reason, it doesn't look like Google are going to let go of their control of what moves through a ChromeCast any time soon.

If you ask me, I'd stick with your nice long HDMI lead for now. Now, if you'll excuse me...
