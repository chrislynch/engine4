@Title:Is Tile the most stalk-y bit of kit ever to be crowd sourced?

I stumbled across the website for [Tile](http://www.thetileapp.com/) recently, whilst researching crowd-sourcing of tech' projects (don't worry, Bubble isn't going to have a $35,000 Kickstarter any time soon).


Tile has raised a phenomenal amount of money through crowd-funded pre-ordering of its gadget; a small Bluetooth 4.0 tracking device that reports its location to an IOS App. Sounds innocuous enough, right? Wrong. You don't need to be within Bluetooth range of one of your Tiles to know where it is - these little digital snitches will report their location via *anyone* running Tile, so you can track your Tile over virtually any distance. The more Tile users there are, the better the range you get.

The website is pretty vague on how this works, but from the video it seems like the Tile app can pick up any Tile in range and transmits all the data back to the shadowy Tile panopticon. According to the video you have to activate this function, but given the short range of Bluetooth transmission, this is either a mode the tile is always working in or every single Tile user sends out a "magic incantation" to nearby Tiles when someone calls in a Tile 911. Regardless of how it works, once the Tile is found the data is pushed out of the legitimate owners of said Tile. On a map, with coordinates. Tile call this "having the rest of the world help you find what you're looking for". When I look at it, I can only think "having the rest of the world help stalkers".

Tiles are small, come with an adhesive backing, and run for a *year* without needing to be charged or replaced. Maybe I've been spending too long writing mysteries in the last month or so, but they look a hell of a lot like the kind of thing that you might hide in, say, someone's purse, or car, or wallet. Something that would go unnoticed. Something that would tell someone, maybe someone *you don't know*, **exactly where you are.**

But hey, I'm probably over egging the sinister pudding here. I emailed Tile a few questions, to set my mind at rest...

1. Given the size of Tile, it would be easy for someone to hide one in a handbag or attach one to a car in secret. How do I know there is not a Tile tracking me?
2. If other Tile users can detect my Tiles and send the data to me, is that via your servers? How is this secured? 
3. Do you know the location of every Tile at all times?

That was a week ago. ***No response as yet.***

Of course, you shouldn't take my word for the fact that this technology is sinister, pervasive, even dangerous in the wrong hands. Take a look at Tile's own video...

***Marvel***, as Tile is dropped discretely into hand bags and purses, vanishing beyond sight to become a silent watcher and reporter of its location.
***Behold*** the smug look on Tile-guy's face as the girl he Tile-d runs past. He knew she was coming. Of course he did. She is Tile-d.
***Feel bilious*** at the bizarre "lost and found" function that puts every other Tile user on the look out for your Tile and then gives you a map-fix on it.

Who stole that girl's bike? Tile guy did, and now he's pulling down the shutters...
