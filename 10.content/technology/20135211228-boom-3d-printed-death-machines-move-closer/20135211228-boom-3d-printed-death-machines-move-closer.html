@Title:Boom! 3D Printed Death Machines Move Closer

Here's a video of another **3D printed gun** being fired (admittedly, fired by pulling a bit of string from a safe distance, but still...)

The first 3D printable gun was designed by Defense Distributed and whilst the blueprints were taken down on the orders of the U.S. State Department, they are still widely available online through the likes of Pirate Bay.

The gun in the video above is the first of what will no doubt be numerous copy-cats, and it is *frightening*. Why? Because it costs $25 to print on a $1,725 printer and is robust enough to survive eight shots. OK, so it has to be manually reloaded and is basically a single shot gun, but do you really want everyone on your street to own a musket? 

Application of Moore's Law to this problem means we are probably going to get a gun that is twice as powerful, or half as expensive, within two years. Given the average teenage boy's fascination with guns, I think it is going to be a lot quicker than that. It's probably an even shorter amount of time until somebody **blows their own fingers off**.

Gun control just a lot tougher.
