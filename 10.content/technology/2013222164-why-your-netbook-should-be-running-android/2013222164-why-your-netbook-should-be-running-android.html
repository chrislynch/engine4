@Title:Why Your Netbook Should Be Running Android

Somewhat less glamourous than Ultrabook and tablets, but possessing a unique charm all of their own, netbooks continue to sell in large volumes. The Asus eeePC range remains particularly popular, especially among Linux users. With laptop screens getting bigger and bigger, but laps remaining stubbornly the same size, netbooks offer the perfect solution for users who need a smaller, more portable device than their desktop-replacing-laptop machine. So, why do so many people say that **netbooks are dead?**


The problem with netbooks, in my experience, is two-fold.

Firstly, they aren't powerful enough to run Windows well. Not a problem for me as a Linux user, but certainly a problem for them in the general marketplace. The "typical" user is looking for an operating system that they recognise, and Linux **just isn't it**. My personal netbook runs an Intel Atom processor and tops out at 2GB of RAM. Ignore what the box says - Windows runs like a drunk, lame dog on that spec and spends more time swapping data on and off the hard drive than it does doing anything else. It's a painful experience that will turn most users off. 

Secondly, most netbooks are not the user's "main" computer. Often, they are not even the secondary home machine. If you're a heavy user of email or cloud file storage systems like Dropbox, that sync your filesystem/data to the cloud, firing up a netbook after a few weeks of not using it is a good way to kill 30 minutes as everything "catches up". I've waiting hours for a Dropbox sync to finish - unlike most of my other machines, the netbook only comes out when I need it.

Or at least ... it used to. Recently I "upgraded" my netbook to run **Android** as the primary OS. The difference is incredible and now my netbook gets fired up every day. I am writing this article on it, in fact. What started out as an experiment to see if I could even *install* Android has turned into a paradigm shift in how I use my various computers.

So, what makes Android on a netbook such an attractive option?

## Speed

An Atom processor and 2GBs of RAM is a spec that any tablet user would drool over. Unsurprisingly, Android runs like a greased whippet on the netbook hardware. Add in the speed advantages of a real hard drive as compared to NAND flash, and you really see a different side to Android performance.

Whilst we're considering specs, it's also worth mentioning that my homebrew Android netbook also has 3 full size USB ports, an SD Card reader, a VGA out, and ethernet. It also has a keyboard... but more on that later.

## What it doesn't have...

Of course, the obviously thing we are missing is multi-touch on the screen. Android actually works perfectly well with a mouse, the only thing I'm not able to do is "pinch" to zoom in and out. Other than that, everything works. In fact, in a lot of instances, I would argue that it works *better*. Touch screen is great, but a mouse and pointer lets me see what I'm clicking. I can't do that with touch screen - my hand gets in the way. Particularly when working with text, that pixel-perfect accuracy when clicking to position your cursors saves a lot of time and eliminates a lot of frustration.

## Optimised for a small screen

One of the other advantages of an Android netbook is that all the apps on the Android platform are designed to work on small screens. Whilst most Windows and Linux apps look cramped on the netbook's small screen, Android apps positively languish in the available space. DroidEdit, my new text editor of choice, provides a wonderfully distraction free writing environment running full screen on my netbook.

Most of the applications I have tried detect the netbook book screen as a "tablet" resolution and run their tablet interfaces. Google Mail, for example, comes with all the landscape bells and whistles.

There are a few apps that I have found that want to force the orientation of the screen into portrait and this is an problem for obvious reasons. However, none of these have been "vital" applications and the forced portrait rotation is often restricted to just the log-in or splash page.

## Optimised for small storage, optimised for cloud storage 

I mentioned earlier the problem of leaving a cloud or internet synced device offline for a long period, after which there is an inevitable period of "catching up". Android neatly sidesteps this issue by only syncing the most recent things. Most apps know that they will either not be allowed to use data when not on WiFi or that they must do so sparingly, so what little does need to be "caught up" is dealt with very quickly.

Admittedly, the fact I now switch my netbook on a lot more often helps to keep things in sync, but the overall approach to synchronization that is built into the very heart of the Android OS means that I can comfortably skip a few days and not encounter issues.

Cloud storage, also something that is very much at the heart of Android, is also handled differently. No app expects to have the capacious expanse of a hard drive to play with, so the expectations on local storage are far lower. Dropbox, for example, only downloads files when you request them. Rather than sync my 30GB plus Dropbox across, I simply pull down the files that I need. Of course, this assumes I am online or have WiFi when I decide that I need the file, as skips over Dropbox's brilliant change and conflict detection, but the fundamental principle remains very sound - if I am doing something that requires a lot of big files, I am probably on my laptop. This doesn't mean I might not need *one* of those files some other time, but I don't want to sync them all, all the time.

## Apps, apps, apps!

If I had written this article a year or so ago, I might have struggled to justify the Android App Marketplace (now "Google Play") as a source for software to replace your desktop apps. Writing this in 2013 however, Google Play is **bristling** with apps to perform just about any task. It seems to me that people are determined to ensure that *anything* they can do on their desktop, they can also do on their Android phone/tablet. The openess of the market is a great help here, and it is easy to find great apps.

If anything, the ability to download apps and run them offline on an Android netbook makes it a serious competitor to a Chromebook in my opinion. 

So, if you want to revitalise some old (or maybe not-so-old) hardware or try out a new way of working, I would highly recommend you build your own Android netbook. (And in my next blog post, I'm going to tell you ***how***)
