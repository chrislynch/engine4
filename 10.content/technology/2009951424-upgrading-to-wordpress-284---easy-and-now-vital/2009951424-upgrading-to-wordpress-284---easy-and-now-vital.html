@Title:Upgrading To Wordpress 284   Easy, And Now Vital

#Upgrading To Wordpress 2.8.4 - Easy, And Now Vital!#

September 5th saw the launch of an exploit based attack on Wordpress blogs worldwide.

The warning comes from <a href="http://lorelle.wordpress.com/2009/09/04/old-wordpress-versions-under-attack/">Lorelle on WordPress</a> after it was discovered that the pernicious attack is exploiting security holes in previous versions of the blogging software, creating a new “hidden” Administrator account and penetrating right down to the database level.

The attacks are said to be “growing by the hour”. Lorelle writes:
<blockquote>There are two clues that your WordPress site has been attacked.

There are strange additions to the pretty permalinks, such as example.com/category/post-title/%&amp;(%7B$%7Beval(base64_decode($_SERVER%5BHTTP_REFERER%5D))%7D%7D|.+)&amp;%/. The keywords are “eval” and “base64_decode.”

The second clue is that a “back door” was created by a “hidden” Administrator. Check your site users for “Administrator (2)” or a name you do not recognize. You will probably be unable to access that account.</blockquote>
<strong>All users are advised to upgrade to the latest version of Wordpress immediately.</strong>

<strong></strong>Reports indicate that hacked sites are extremely difficult to repair. As the damage reaches all the way down to the database, a simple reinstall will leave the hack in place. The generally accepted remedy appears to be to export your content and to import it into a new, clean, installation. That means binding a fond farewell to your settings and configuration.

Endless emnity for the thoughtless protagonists behind all this aside, there is a heart-warming amount of support in the Wordpress community (of which I am a contributing member) for those affected. It really is nothing more than outright destructiveness and vandalism, the fact that it is being perpetrated digitally making it no less annoying, viscious, mindless, or upsetting for the victim.

Thankfully, Wordpress is very easy to install. My upgrade to 2.8.4 was a simple click on a link at the top of my dashboard, and the wonderful Wordpress has done everything else for me. Perhaps I should thanks the script kiddies out there messing with people's lovingly crafted blogs ... I now have new features to play with :-D
