@Title:SOLVED: Blackberry keeps downloading old emails as unread

## The Problem


A Blackberry keeps downloading a small set of emails from the past as new, unread emails.

Deleting them via the handset, whether you do it on the handheld or "handheld and mailbox", does nothing. They come back again, like tiny digital zombies.

Deleting the offending emails in Outlook also does not appear to resolve the problem.

## The Solution

I fixed this issue simply by logging into the IMAP Mailbox directly and deleting the offending emails. Non-Microsoft Webmail is great for this, if you have it. If not, ask your SysAdmin.

## The Suspicion

Blackberry and Outlook both do odd things to IMAP, so going direct to the source was the only way to fix this.

Worth keeping in mind for other Blackberry related problems with troublesome mailboxes.
