@Title:How to use Markdown in eMail and Google Mail

If you don't know what [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) is then you're missing something **great**. A short hand way of writing richly formatted text in a plain text editor, it is infinitely easier and more intuitive than HTML, human readable in its unformatted state, and (because it is plain text) compatible with just about anything. As a writer, I know only too well the frustration of formatting getting in the way of writing and Markdown eliminates that.


When it comes to writing, one thing that I write a *lot* of is emails. Because I'm detail oriented and a lot of my work (both technical and creative) involves a lot of detail, these emails tend to get pretty long as well. I'm one of those people who will use headings in an email, then sub-headings, then sub-sub-headings, and heaven help you if you don't pay attention. I find this way of work infinitely more effective than attaching reports and documents though as all my email content, thanks to Google Mail, is fully indexed.

Up until now, however, wrting emails in Markdown and then sending them through GMail has been a process of many steps. Dodging the new compose interface for as long as I can, I write my Markdown email in a text editor. When my wonderful missive is ready, I convert that Markdown content to HTML. Depending on where I am this is sometimes done at a command line, sometimes with a GUI, or sometimes with an online tool. Markdown's general ubiquity online means I'm never far from *some* method of converting, no matter how convoluted. Finally, with Markdown safely converted to HTML and any last minute changes made, I copy and paste the resulting content, as rich text, into GMail.

I would abhor such a convulted process if it weren't for the fact that writing in Markdown saves me so much time and helps me organise my thoughts so clearly. Perhaps I'm an addict but, if so, I admit it.

Help is at hand for Markdown and GMail addicts however in the form of **Markdown Here**.

Markdown Here is a nifty Chrome Extension that can reach into a rich-text text area and convert the contents from Markdown to HTML *and back again*. Since installing this today I've been emaiing up a storm and wondering just *why* I put up with such a convoluted process to write a long email before now. 

## Getting Started with Markdown and Google Mail (GMail) 

1. [Install Markdown Here via the Chrome Store](http://markdown-here.com/get.html)
2. Restart your browser/email client
3. Enter GMail
4. Start up a new message
5. Marvel briefly at the *teeny tiny space* that Google have given you to write your email in and, probably, hit buttons and keystrokes until you have broken out or gone full screen
6. Write your email in Markdown, glorious Markdown
7. Right click on the content of your email (no highlighting required) and click "Markdown Here"

You should find the content of your email instantly updated to the HTML/rich text equivalent of your Markdown text, ready to be fired off to an excited recipient.

## For advanced users, try changing the stylesheet

You can change the way that Markdown Here formats your text by altering its stylesheet. Simply right click on the Markdown Here toolbar button, select "Options" and scroll down to the style section. My personal hack is to change blockquotes to be in red. Rather than use these for quotations I use them to highlight actions I want other people to take. It doesn't make them take them, but it does make it easier to chase them up.

> "It has your name by it. It's in bright red. I wrote it in bright bold red letters in the email, and put your name on it, how exactly did you miss that?"
* Not what it is really like to work with me. I probably swear more IRL*

## For coders, try formatting code. For maths nerds, bust out your TeX

The version of Markdown that Markdown here uses supports syntax highlight in code. Awesome if you are sending a block of code to a collegue. It also supports TeX, which allows for the formatting for complex formulae.

## Other fun things to try with Markdown Here

Markdown Here isn't just for email, you can use it with many other rich text websites and web apps ***including Evernote***. I haven't tried this yet but as a one of the many people who have been calling for Markdown support in Evernote for a long time, this may present a solution. There's a growing [list of Markdown Here compatible things](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Compatibility).

## But, I don't use Chrome.

Good news, Markdown Here is also available for Firefox and Safari. If you use IE, please just... don't. It's breaking the internet.

## But, I don't use GMail

Never mind, young one, there is still time to learn. If you use Thunderbird however, there is a Markdown Here extension for you.
