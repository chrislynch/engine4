[Google Reader is being taken behind the chemical sheds and shot on July 1st 2013](http://googlereader.blogspot.co.uk/2013/03/powering-down-google-reader.html). Its users aren't happy. 100,000 of them have signed a [petition to save Google Reader](http://thenextweb.com/google/2013/03/15/petition-to-save-google-reader-passes-100000-signatures-but-dont-expect-google-to-reverse-its-decision/).

Arguably, maintaining Google Reader is not good business sense for Google. Its major rivals on the social scene, Facebook and Twitter, have long since shut down RSS in and out of their platform (unless you use a third party app) and Google+ would no doubt benefit from more people using it to get their news. However, Google+ is unlikely to be the "go to" destination for RSS refugees like myself so unless they reverse this decision (not likely, unless you are a Kryptonian and prepared to fly around the globle ***really fast***) then we're going to be reading our news somewhere else.

Thankfully, Feedly, which has been my on-again-off-again Google Reader front end for some time, have unveiled plans to create a stand-alone RSS environment to replace Google Reader. For those not familiar with Feedly, up until now it has taken your Google Reader subscriptions and presented the data in a "magazine" format. I makes the news pretty, and a bit more fun. It also has a very nice smartphone client, a bit Flipboard-esque but with far more control over what you get to see.

[Feedly are calling this "Project Normandy".](http://blog.feedly.com/2013/03/14/google-reader/). The transition, they claim, will be seamless. Fingers crossed. Right now, I'm making sure I've got Feedly set up *just how I want it*.

## Don't count out Digg

If you're not as keen on Feedly's layout as I am, you might want to consider Digg's [recent unveiled replacement for Google Reader](http://blog.digg.com/post/45355701332/were-building-a-reader).

Personally, I think Feedly is a better option - they have a reader already and have been fine tuning the interface and mobile apps for some time. Digg are coming from a "standing start" and whilst you can't critcise their opportunistic moxie, they might not have the time to get the job done.
