@Title:Drupal In 57 Seconds

#Drupal In 57 Seconds#

As the "tech" side of the blog is heating up, and there is a good chance that there will be a lot of Drupal posts over the coming months, I thought it would be worthwhile linking to this really cool video from Ping Vision

<a href="http://pingv.com/videos/1/what-drupal-57-seconds">What is Drupal? ... in 57 seconds | pingVision</a>.

They definitely explain Drupal faster than I can, and it is a lovely example of some kinetic typography at the same time.
