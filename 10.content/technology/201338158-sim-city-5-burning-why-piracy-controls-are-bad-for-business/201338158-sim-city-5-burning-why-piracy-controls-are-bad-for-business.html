@Title:Sim City 5 Burning Why Piracy Controls Are Bad For Business

The latest version of Sim City (Sim City 5) is the latest game to be plagued by the twin monsters of needing an internet connection to play (bad) and having insufficient server capacity to cope with the demands of players (stupid, and bad planning).


Following hot on the heels of the much vexed Diablo III, which had similar problems, it seems that the games makers **have learnt nothing**.

[Amazon have today removed Sim City 5 from sale](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-21712910) in the face of numerous returns and complaints.

So, what's to be done? Well, firstly, games makers need to reassess their approach to piracy.

Games piracy has gone on certainly for as long as I can remember there being games. When I had a ZX Spectrum, people used cassette players to copy games. When I had a PC, the advent of the CD Writer sent games makers running to the hills in their droves screaming in terror (where they met up with the tribes who had fled there when they heard about *bulletin boards*). Then came the internet, Usenet, torrents ... if you're a games maker then it seems like there is an almost wave of innovations that are designed to make it easier for people to steal your stuff. XBoxes get chipped, encryptions get cracked. Pirates **are everywhere**.

Or are they?

[Various](http://www.codinghorror.com/blog/2008/12/my-software-is-being-pirated.html) [sources](http://www.gamasutra.com/php-bin/news_index.php?story=17350#.UToH8kGc4pI) online seem to put game piracy at around 90% of the userbase. 

Despite this, the problem remains that assuming *everyone* wants to steal your game means that you start treating every customer like a potential criminal. From the customer's perspective - that stinks. 

You start to embed onnerous security in your products not to *protect* the legitimate buyer, but to ensure that you, as vendor, know where every single copy of your game is. And who is playing. And when. The world of dongles beckons. There's a certain irony of a game where the player weilds a god-like omnipotent power over the denizens of a city being crippled by a vendor who wants to wield a god-like omnipotent power over... well you get the picture. And yet, if figures of 90% software piracy are to be believed, the majority of are *are* criminals?

Personally, I think those numbers are skewed and whilst they are useful for legitimising the presence of stringent and restrictive customer controls, the inescapable reality is that treating legitmate customers as pirates, or as criminals, is just bad for business.

If only 1 in 10 customers want to pay for your product, you don't piss them off if you want to stay in business.

So, what is to be done about software piracy?

Whatever comes next, the most important thing is that it needs to be done **right**. There would be far fewer complianants if EA's servers were fast, responsive, and a slow internet connection (or even, gasp, **no** internet connection) didn't mean you couldn't play. 

Personally, I believe the best piracy protection is the protection that is no protection at all. Instead of trying to *make* your customers pay, focus your efforts on **making your customers want to pay**.

Here, perhaps, are some ways how:

## Downloadable Content (DLC)

A game like Sim City is ripe for DLC. Make the DLC optional, but make it *desirable*.

It doesn't matter if people are stealing the game if they are paying for the downloaded content.

And yes, of course, some DLC will also be pirated. Don't sweat it. Rotate your shields, recharge your phasers, make the next batch *harder* to copy and **release some more compelling content**.

Gamers are completists. That's why they replay games on harder levels and why they want to unlock things. Even for people who dislike DLC (like me), it *works*.

## Real World Content

Skylanders actually does this very well. It's pretty hard to pirate an action figure that unlocks a part of the game. Whilst I joked about the use of dongles previously, they do work, most of the time. (There's always the worry of a [dongle crack](http://www.wisegeek.com/what-is-a-dongle-crack.htm)).

## Just make it _good_

For me, the ultimate in making people want to pay is simply ... **making them want to pay**.

In her recent [TED Talk, Amanda Palmer](http://youtu.be/xMj_P_6H69g) gave an inspiring explanation of the "Art of Asking". I'm a documented opponent of much of the crowd sourcing the goes on in the comics community, but there is a simplicity and elegance to Amanda's Palmers concept of creating something that people want and making is *easier to pay for it than to steal it* that appeals, very much, to the engineer in me.

## In conclusion

For now, it seems like we need to wait for the technology, or the psychology, of the games makers to catch up. I expect to see more controls in games, not fewer, and think we are a long way from anything like the open source ethos penetrating the world of major games makers.

For now, I'll just keep giving my software away for free. I'm sure the money thing will take care of itself.
