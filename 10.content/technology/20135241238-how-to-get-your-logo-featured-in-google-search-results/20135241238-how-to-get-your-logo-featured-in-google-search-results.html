@Title:How To Get Your Logo Featured In Google Search Results

On May 16th 2013, Google announced a new microformat schema for logos.


Part of the Organisation markup on [schema.org](http://www.schema.org), the markup is remarkably simple.

    <div itemscope itemtype="http://schema.org/Organization">
    <a itemprop="url" href="http://www.example.com/">Home</a>
    <img itemprop="logo" src="http://www.example.com/logo.png" />
    </div>

Considering the amount of time and energy that goes into creating a logo, especially when compared to how simple the markup above is, getting your brand to appear in the search results should be a no-brainer.

So, anyone want to make me a fancy logo for the blog?
