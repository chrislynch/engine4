@Title:Why ads in Google Mail don't matter (or "How I learnt to stop worrying and love GMail")

This isn't an article about PRISM, Tempura, or any of the other "business hands your data over to government/law enforcement"/"1984 is real"/"THEY READ YOUR EMAIL" scandals that have been dominating the news and social networks of late. I've read a lot of what is out there and whilst I have opinions on those things, I'm not convinced that writing them up here will add anything to the conversation. The issue is massive, and the conversation is equally so. Possibly the best way to fight PRISM, if you agree with those that believe it needs (or needed) to be fought, was to bring it into the light of day. Not because we now know about it (and [knowing is half the battle](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=knowing+is+half+the+battle&safe=active)) but because the sheer volume of internet traffic now containing undoubted hot-words like "encyption" and "NSA" has probably reached the point that the NSA's servers are creaking and blowing out steam trying to process it all. PRISM will now eat itself, and we can all go back to sending pictures of cats asking for cheeseburgers to each other without being afraid that the government might be encouraged by the fact that most of us are halfwits.

No, let's put *all of that* that to one side. This article is all about **adverts in Google Mail** and *something I hate on the Internet*.

## What's the scandal, haven't there always been adverts in Google Mail?

If you don't have a paid-for Google Apps account, then you will see adverts in your Google Mail. For as long as I can remember, these adverts have always been based on Google indexing the content of your email. This makes them potentially some of the most relevant adverts you will ever see. Despite this, I can honestly say that I've clicked less than 10 Google Mail adverts in the whole time I've used the service, which is *years*. Maybe the algorithm actually *sucks* or maybe my years of internet use have made me immune to advertising. The fact that I regularly repost adverts for Magical Murphy to my Facebook account should guide us to towards the former, perhaps.

Despite my immunity, Microsoft have built an advertising bonfire and doused it with scandal-petrol over this feature recently, all as part of their [ongoing "Scroogled" campaign](http://www.scroogled.com/email/). I can only presume I'm not their target audience. 

Microsoft have more lawyers than me, so I won't say that they have deliberately misrepresented the situation. I do disagree with them that the adverts that Google now insert into GMail are disguised as normal messages though. In *my opinion*, the fact that they have **Ad** written next to them, just like a paid-for search result, and have a cross to remove them, and don't have any of the other normal email controls, *and* appear (at least for me) to live exclusively on the **Promotions** tab, in fact only at the top of the Promotions tab... are enough pointers for users to understand that what they are seeing is an advert. 

Microsoft are keen to point out that, [according to a GfK-Roper survey, "88% percent of adults disapprove of scanning email content for advertising purposes.](http://www.politico.com/story/2013/02/microsoft-renews-google-attack-on-email-privacy-87302.html#ixzz2cPkG45pU). They also point out that about two-thirds of Americans said they didn't know whether any major email provider used the practice. Damning statistics, for sure. They don't mention that in another recent survey of 1000 Americans, [77% couldn't correctly say why the Cold War was fought](http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/2011/03/20/how-dumb-are-we.html). It's probably not a relevant stat but, for me, it adds some colour and should remind us all the you can always find 80% of people to agree with just about *anything* if you're asking the right people.

For their part, [Google say that they have been misrepresented by media reports on the topic of email privacy](http://mashable.com/2013/08/14/google-email-privacy-out-of-context/).

## Now, on to the "hate" part

There are three major problems with what the activity above represents.

Firstly, the endless war of words between tech giants is one of the things that I hate about working in the technology sector. It's the tip of the iceberg that grows downwards to include patent wars, FUD campaigns, and all the delineation between different "camps" of users that only serves to decrease the free flow of knowledge and information and creates a culture where still, after so much time, some people are still confused by and scared of computers. 

The second issue here is the expectation of services for free on the Internet. The article that spawned *this article* was shared with me by a social network, along with the comment

> OMG! Read this! Google are reading ALL your email! Delete your GMail now!

I actually follow this person on Facebook. I'm about to start a Kickstarter campaign to have them fired into the heart of the sun.

I don't have a problem with said person objecting to Google scanning (not *reading*) their email to serve adverts. It's the moral outrage that they feel at Google doing something with the data that *you* put into *their* system. It's the moral outrage of users who are happy to consume a free service but *not happy* for the makers of that service to extract any value for that exchange. It's adverts in Tumblr, it's adverts in apps. There are a great many [truly free things](http://www.gnu.org/) on the Internet, but an service email doesn't *have* to be one of them. Google aren't in any way compelled to provide this service and we aren't compelled to use it.

We can choose to use Google Mail and accept the contract that they will show you adverts based on your email content **or** you can go and use something else.

What you *can't* do is use Google Mail and all of its functionality, the free storage, the integration with your Android phone, etc. and not see the ads. Unless you pay for a Google Apps account, *but who wouldo that* because we all want this stuff for free, ***don't we?***

This isn't a pro-Google, anti-Microsoft article. Take a look at the rest of this blog for examples of me taking Google to task as well. This is a common sense, play fair type of blog post. This is a "shut up and drink your tea" type of blog post. You did *pay* for that tea, didn't you?

## Dude, you said there were three problems

Oh yes, it also annoys me when people don't understand statistics and this gets exploited to make people make bad decisions. Please watch this now because, in the half-baked research I did when writing this little blog post, this was the most terrifying thing that I found
