#MWM#1 Reviewed On Amazon.co.uk ... The New Wave Of UK Horror Comics Has Arrived...#

<blockquote><strong>The new wave of UK "Horror" comics has arrived...</strong>
Although MWM (sub-titled "Making Deals With Devils") is usually filed under the all encompassing wing of wing of Horror comics, to do so does the title a discredit, as there's a lot more to the four tales contained within, than the usual splat and gore that tries to pass itself as "modern horror", especially in the sense of graphical and comic work...

Owing more to the likes of EC Comics, The Twilight Zone and early seventies movie compendiums like "Asylum", "Making Deals With Devils" delivers tales with a twist, and like all the best examples of this genre, you don't see the twist coming until the final frame - esp. in "The Exchange" (although, with "Thirty Pieces", the title gives away the ending, and as soo as the Romnas apear, well, I knew I was on the right track, but it's a still an enjoyable romp)...

If you like the "good old days" and believe (as do I!), that there's far more to horror and suspense than buckets of blood and dying virgins and are looking for one of the best British comic titles to emerge in the last decade, then you owe it to yourself to check out MWM...Seriously. The era of late night chills and frights has returned, and I couldn't be happier...</blockquote>
