<blockquote>For those of you out there that dig dark comic shorts with twists, this is for you! Decent art mixed with great ideas and admirable story execution, I'm looking forward to what these guys will throw at us next!

Recommended for those out there who read 2000AD (particularly Future Shocks), Negative Burn, and other comics anthologies; also recommended to those who enjoy shows like The Twilight Zone, The Outer Limits, and Tales From the Darkside.

"Making Deals With Devils" is a fine example of what an independant publisher can do with limited resources and make it succeed beyond typical or even above-average expectations.

Bravo, MWM!</blockquote>
