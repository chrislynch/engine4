<blockquote>Chris Lynch and Stu.art make up the MWM studio. They've published three successful editions of their horror anthology, all of which are to a high standard.

Focusing on horror, but with a few different twists, MWM delivers a complete package. Stuart's art and Chris' writing go together very well, as does the art from some of the other artists featured. It's really a showcase for Chris' imaginative stories and Stuart's art, but they deserve it. Stuart's dark, shadow heavy artwork really suits the title, and Chris has a certain liking toward the horror genre that shows in some great short stories.

At a fairly standard US comics price of £2.50 and (£2.39 for #1), it's a tad more than most indie titles, but the quality shows.</blockquote>
