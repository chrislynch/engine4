#Hypergraphia To Appear In Insomnia's Survival Anthology#

<strong>What do bloggers, private detectives, and faerie princes all have in common?</strong>

They are all in <em>Hypergraphia</em>, a new story appearing in Insomnia's "Survival" anthology.

This time around I have been teamed up with the extremely talented <a href="http://www.neurotic-elf.deviantart.com/">Valia</a>, who has a line in moody artwork that will certainly suit the story very well indeed ... unsuprisingly, this is a dark one folks!

The previous Insomnia anthology, Choices, sold extremely well at the Bristol Comic Con and is currently available via Amazon. The book is consistently picking up good reviews, a testament to the editorial direction of the team from Insomnia as well as the very talented creators who contribute their time and hard work.

So, keep your eyes peeled for "Survival" whilst I search for a cure for <em>Hypergraphia</em> ...
