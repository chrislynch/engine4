@Title:Outrageous! Aquaman tops the charts... for malware

18.6% of searches for "Aquaman" will result in sites containing spyware, viruses, or other malware. That's the official line from McAfee, one of the world's largest providers of anti-virus software. As if being the butt of the "Aquaman Sucks" meme and having [tumbling comic book sales](http://www.comichron.com/monthlycomicssales/2013/2013-01.html) wasn't enough, it seems that DC's swim-nerd also has a case of digital crabs.


Aquaman isn't alone in having something nasty though. Mr. Fantatic is almost as plague ridden, with 18.22% of searches requiring a trip to the virtual STD clinic shortly after and The Hulk smashes in with 17.3%. Iron Man and Superman, comparatively, languish at the 15% mark, probably as a result of a proliferation of clean, legitimate sites talking about Iron Man 3 and Man of Steel.

## Sweet Christmas! Where can I go for legitimate Aquaman content?

If you read the details of [McAfee's Toxic Superhero Blog Post](https://blogs.mcafee.com/consumer/toxicsuperhero) you'll see that to hit these results you actually need to extend your search criteria a little to something like "Aquaman Free Download" or "Aquaman Trailer". McAfee are quick to point out that the rise in popularity of superheroes is why internet scammers are now targeting these search terms. If that isn't proof that superheroes are mainstream, I don't know what is!

In the meantime, make sure your virus scanner is up to date and remember that downloading free Aquaman content funds terrorism. Or Black Manta. Probably.
