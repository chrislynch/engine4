Back then, he was just in the early stages of getting his punk rock, counter culture magazine "Mass Movement" off the ground. He was on issue 4, maybe 5.

Sometime later and Tim is still going strong. So strong, in fact, that he's given over a page of the latest issue of Mass Movement magazine to me to complete their regular column/feature "It Ruined My Life".

I won't spoil the article, but obvious I talk about comics. And magic. And a certain <em>Grant Morrison</em>.

Enjoy.
