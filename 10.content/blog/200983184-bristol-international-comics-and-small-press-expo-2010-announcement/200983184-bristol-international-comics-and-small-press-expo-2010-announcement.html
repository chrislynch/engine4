The con will run over 3 days this year; 21 - 23 May to be precise; and will be spread between the Ramada and Mercure Hotels. This year's double con (the seperate but affiliated Bristol Comic Con and Bristol Small Press Expo) also appear to have merged to create this single super-sized convention.

Also, there's some guy called Chris Claremont coming.

Exciting news for the return of our of the UKs best conventions!
