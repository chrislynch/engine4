@Title:Convention Preparation: The Ten Things To Never Forget

Tomorrow I'll be hitting my first comic convention for some time. I'll be going in what I call "stealth mode" - paying for my ticket and roaming the alleys between tables as a free agent. *(What do I think about creators who want a free ticket but don't do anything to support the show? That's another blog post entirely...)*


What this has got me thinking about though is the "pre-convention check list", that indispensable list of "must have" items that I have built up over a good few years of convention-eer-ing. Here's the list, for anyone else getting ready for a show and wondering what it is that they might have forgotten...

## 1: The Pull-Up Banner

If you have never exhibited at a convention before, make sure you get yourself a banner. They are a de-facto standard nowadays and the essential part of your arsenal. Don't expect people to ask who you are - tell them.

## 2: Table Cloth

My first two conventions, I forgot the table cloth and had to beg/borrow/steal one to cover up a fairly ropey wooden panel table. Lots of conventions provide table cloths now, but I still always still take one... just in case. 

Consider like your towel in the Hitchhiker's Guide Universe. **Know where your table cloth is**. And, just because the con gives you one, doesn't mean you can't have your own jazzy number. Mine has skulls.

## 3: A "Float"

If you comic book is ?2.50, expect to be given fivers, tenners, and twenties and have to make change. Most people hit the cash point on the way to the convention, and it is just embarassing if you can't break down a note after you've broken down a *person* and made them buy your comic.

Having a float is just a professional requirement - if you are there to sell, make it easy for your customer.

## 4: Water, Chocolate, etc.

Conventions are tiring. Food and water, especially the cheap energy hit of some chocolate are essential. Not meaning to be churlish, but a lot of places that hold conventions are also **very** expensive to eat and drink in, so think ahead and make sure you take provisions.

Come Sunday morning, when you trying to shake off that hangover, you will thank your lucky stars for those provisions.

## 5: Charge up your mobile

Conventions happen in real time on Twitter and Facebook just as much in the real world. You can't be everywhere at once, so a charged up mobile can be your link to the virtual side of the convention going on around you.

Make sure you follow the convention's Twitter feed and hashtags to keep up with the news and get involved.

## 6: Stock (some of which thou shalt sacrifice)

I believe in travelling light with stock. You are not going to shift hundreds of copies of your indie comic at a convention so save your time, and save your back muscles, by taking a good *range* of stock in sensible quantities.

Also, be prepared to swap and share with other creators. I much prefer to swap comics for comics with other creators, if they are willing. The contacts you make and the feedback you can get are invaluable.

The only exception to this is if you're pitching yourself to them. If you are, be courteous and buy some of their products. It's common sense - you need to understand what they are about if you're going to work with them.

## 7: Business Cards

I've always believed that the best business card is the kind that's between 24 and 32 pages long, has pictures and words, and tells a story. However, traditional business cards are also very useful.

Make sure you give phone, email, and social network contact details. These don't need to be posh, you're trying to impress Patrick Bateman, but they need to **exist**. If you give me your number on a scrap of paper, or make me write it down, **I will lose it**.

## 8: Pens, Paper, Stationery, etc.

For artists, sketching as some sort of indentured servitude seems to be the norm at comic conventions. As a writer, I've dabbled with "live writing" at conventions and whilst it's always worked for *me*, I wouldn't recommend it.

However, even if you don't want to write on a figurative tightrope like I do, conventions are often the time when you get to thrash out ideas with other creators and really "talk shop". Be prepared to work in the downtime (like Sunday afternoon, the long great downtime of all cons).

## 9: Painkillers

There is not a convention on Earth that someone does not come to ill, and not a convention on Earth that does not induce "con-flu" in most of the attendees. Pack some painkillers and cold remedy. I don't care if you're from the North, pack some painkillers and cold remedy.

## 10: "The Pitch"

Now, this one might be where I lose a few of you...

If you're at a con, behind a table, selling a comic... be prepared to talk about. Be able to precise it down for someone who takes the time to ask what it is, and be prepared to talk about it. Have a pitch. Because if you don't, *this* is what the guy on the other side of the table is probably thinking... **"You made the damn thing. You wrote, or drew it, or did both. Care enough to tell me what it is, because I've only go so much money here and right now you're not getting any of it."**

Like I said, I might lose a few of you there, but those are the facts.

## 11: Fun

Oh yeah, I almost forgot - have fun. Conventions are hard work, but they are also an infrequent opportunity to be in the company of like minded people who share your passions (well, not *all* your passions). Make the most of it!
