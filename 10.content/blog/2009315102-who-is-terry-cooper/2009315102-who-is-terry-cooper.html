@Title:Who Is Terry Cooper

#Who Is Terry Cooper?#

Now that I can reveal exactly <a href="2009/03/15/the-clockwork-occultist-to-appear-in-accent-uks-victoriana-anthology/">who and what Terry and I are working on "The Clockwork Occultist" for</a>, we thought it was high time that we introduced the man himself.

So, without further ado ...
<blockquote><strong>Terry Cooper</strong> was born nearly 40 years ago in an ambulance in North London. He moves to Wales in 1980 and did whatever he could to get through his schooling alive.

He had a short but fruitful career in the 1990s as a member of the rap group, 'Best Shot', touring the UK with East 17.

Nowadays, he is a full-time artist and illustrator, producing everything from storyboards, cartoon characters and company logos to book and CD
covers. In addition, he is a published novelist with the book, 'KANGAZANG!' and is currently writing the sequel. He also writes a fortnightly column for the local press.

If that wasn't enough, he also runs a computer animation studio, Strangetown Animation, and provides voice-overs and narration for advertisements, films and cartoons. Terry has two children, but is single (ladies!) and lives in Pontypridd.</blockquote>
