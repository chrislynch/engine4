#Al Nolan Has A New Website#

Al Nolan has a shiny new website at <a href="http://alnolan.synthasite.com/">http://alnolan.synthasite.com</a>

Definitely worth checking out, especially if you've missed any back issues of "Sancho". It's "Father Ted Meets Hellblazer", and has twice been nominated for an Eagle Award.

Just in case Al is reading this post, I even will go on record as saying that it is almost as good as Monkeys with Machineguns. <em>Almost.</em> ;-)

Speaking of which, somewhere in the "to do" pile is an MWM Sancho story entitled "The Rubbernecker". More on that later!
