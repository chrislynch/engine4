<blockquote>Do you ever get that feeling that you are not in your body? Do you ever get that feeling that your body isn’t you, that it’s just this bag of flesh and fat and bone that you are somehow trapped inside, looking out? I used to feel that way all the time; the strange detachment from what was happening all around me, the effortless disconnection from the world. Up until a few months ago I’d lived my life like a receiver hanging off a phone, just drifting back and forth with that buzzing tone coming and going in my head. A corpse hanging from a noose made of spiralling plastic cord. Effortless disconnection.

That’s all stopped now. I’ve found a new way to live.</blockquote>
