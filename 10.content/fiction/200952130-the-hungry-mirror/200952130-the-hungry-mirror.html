@Title:The Hungry Mirror

#The Hungry Mirror#

More MWM Live practice. This one took a little longer, had trouble getting rid of the word "crawl" from the list of random words.

He couldn't see Laura, but could hear movement downstairs. Cups clicked together, water pouring. He guessed that she was making tea, and was surprised that he didn't immediately want some. Looking up, he could see why.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="float: left; font-size: 300%;"><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;">Banging on the surface of the mirror that hung above Laura's bed, desperately trying to break through from the other side, from whatever place it was that lay on the other side of Laura's mirror, was a carbon copy of Travis. The copy's skin looked parched, cracking in places, and it clutched at its throat from time to time. Behind it, other versions of Travis crawled across the surface, like men trapped under ice, their mouths open in soundless screams.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="float: left; font-size: 300%;"><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;">“There's no point looking at them,” said Laura as she walked in, holding the predicted cups of tea. “They never do anything else. They are such base creatures.”</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="float: left; font-size: 300%;"><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;">Her voice was emotionless and yet Travis did not find it cold. There was some pure about it, some clear and resonant, like listening to church bells chiming on a quiet morning. He realised it was not the world that had become quieter though, but his own mind.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="float: left; font-size: 300%;"><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;">“Will I miss them?” he asked. His own voice, although not quite as clear as Laura's, had a clarity that he had never experienced before, as if the world moved slightly aside to accommodate his words.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="float: left; font-size: 300%;"><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;">“No,” replied Laura. “The mirror is so greedy, it always takes the needs first. Another few days, and you will never want or need anything again.”</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="float: left; font-size: 300%;"><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;">“I thought so,” replied Travis. “I heard you making tea, but didn't think for a moment I wanted any. I'm sure I used to love tea.”</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="float: left; font-size: 300%;"><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;">“You did,” said Laura, “But now you are free even of that foible.”</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="float: left; font-size: 300%;"><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;">“Man unbound ...” whispered Travis, remembering the name of the book that Laura had given him, back at the very beginning of their bizarre experiment.</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="float: left; font-size: 300%;"><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;">“Not quite yet,” Laura countered, and poured the boiling tea across Travis' chest. “We have still to remove your pain, and your fear.”</span></span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;" align="justify"><span style="font-size: x-small;"><span style="float: left; font-size: 300%;"><span style="font-style: normal;"> </span></span><span style="font-style: normal;">But Travis didn't hear her. The part of him that was screaming in pain was already trapped on the other side of the mirror.</span></span></p>
