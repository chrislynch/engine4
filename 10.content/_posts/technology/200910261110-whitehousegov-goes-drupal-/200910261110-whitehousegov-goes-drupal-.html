@Title:Whitehousegov Goes Drupal 

#WhiteHouse.gov Goes Drupal #

My favourite piece of open source CMS software has added another significant scalp, with <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">http://www.whitehouse.gov</a> making the switch to Drupal.

The move has been orchestrated by Dries himself, through Aquia, along with some third party contractors based in the US. (More details and specifics are available via<a href="http://techpresident.com/blog-entry/whitehousegov-goes-drupal"> techPresident</a>).

Much is being made of the Obama administration, or at least some aspect of it, making the "open source choice". With a foot in each camp (both the closed and open source worlds), I have to wonder if the move is significant and, in a way, I hope it isn't.

Much is being made of the choice as if it represents some fundamental decision by the US Government to chose open source for reasons <em>other</em> than it being the <strong>best technical solution</strong>. <a href="http://buytaert.net/whitehouse-gov-using-drupal">Dries has a great take on why this is the case</a>, and I wish more of the news articles out there were picking up on these points.

As an advocate of Drupal, and of open source in general, it being chosen because it is the best solution is the <em>only </em>option that I can support ... because it is the only option that takes open source forward.

Chose open source because it has a better cost/benefit balance, chose it because it is lower risk, more secure, or chose it because it fits your needs. But don't chose it <em>because</em> it is open source, because that's the same as choosing it because it is <em>Microsoft</em> or <em>Google</em> or <em>Sony</em> or any other brand name.

If we can make the playing field cost, risks, time, and function and eliminate the FUD peddled by others, then products and platforms like Drupal <em>will</em> be the best fit, will be selected, and the presence and market share of open source will improve.

But please, let's not turn a victory dance into an awkward "Dad at a wedding" moment on the grave of some unknown closed source system. It is unbecoming of us all.
