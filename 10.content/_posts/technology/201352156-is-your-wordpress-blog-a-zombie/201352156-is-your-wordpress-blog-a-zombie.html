@Title:Is Your Wordpress Blog A Zombie

[A recent report from security consultancy Incapsula](http://www.incapsula.com/the-incapsula-blog/item/715-wordpress-security-alert-pingback-ddos) concluded that an DDOS attack launched against a large gaming website used approximately 2,500 Wordpress sites, including gizmodo.it and zendesk.com. [The full list of offenders is here](http://www.incapsula.com/wp-botnet-pingback-abuse.txt)


What is most interesting is that these sites hadn't been compromised. Instead, the attack leveraged new default functionality in Wordpress 3.5 to generate a flood of "ping back" requests to the site under attack. Ping backs are designed to aid cross referencing between blogs, but can be used to generate millions of requests to a single website from a range of IP addresses.

The report goes on say that the majority of Wordpress sites are now vulnerable to this sort of abuse, as Ping Back is switched on by default in version 3.5 of Wordpress. The problem is therefore serious and **massive** - there are to the order of 100 million Wordpress blogs in existence.

In short? There are a lot of zombies out there, and your blog could be one of them.

For a lot of people, Wordpress is the "go to" blogging platform. In many instances, it has become the CMS equivalent to "no one got sacked for buying IBM". It is so ubiquitous and well known that you can slide a Wordpress site into any content strategy and even the most dusty Luddite will nod sagely and say something like "I've heard of that". Designers and developers alike love it (mostly) and this really a part of the problem.

Running a Wordpress sites are not the same as running a hosted Tumblr page. Even though you might use it for the same things, the underlying power of the beast is totally different, and most users won't take the time to review security settings or even to upgrade for the latest security features.

*Still*, for the bright sparks still paying attention at the front of the class...

## Here's how to make sure your Wordpress blog isn't being used for DDOS

The guys over at Wordpress aren't going to fix this any time soon. [The potential for Ping Back DDOS from Wordpress has been a known issue for over six years](https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/4137) so, in the words of zombie killing maestro Tallahassee... "It's time to nut up, or shut up!"

### Switch off Ping Back

You can disable Ping Back from your Wordpress Control Panel in `Settings>Discussion>Default article settings`

### Double Tap: Delete the xmlrpc.php file

The Incapsula report recommends the deletion of the `xmlrpc.php` from the root of your Wordpress directory. This is a serious "double tap" as, with that file gone, the offending code is gone with it. However, you should expect to lose some other functionality as well - anything that uses RPC like the Wordpress Android App could be affected (in short, I didn't test this!)
