@Title:Tumblr had it coming... why Yahoo! blocked adult content

[Violet Blue reported today on Yahoo/Tumblr's decision to render any Tumblr blogs containing adult content invisible to search engines.](http://www.zdnet.com/adult-tumblr-blogs-now-removed-from-every-form-of-search-possible-7000018295/) It is estimated that these changes render around 12 million Tumblr blogs invisible even to the local, Tumblr, search, a figure that represents around 10% of their user base.


Users are reported to be furious, but there are no figures as yet to indicate any mass-exodus from the Tumblr site. There are thousands of posts from people looking for an alternative place to host their content though, so any site that is identified as a safe haven for these users can expect a spike in their user stats.

I, for one, am not surprised to see this happen.

Tumblr is one of the great flip-flopping u-turning companies of all time. David Karp says that there will never be adverts on Tumblr and that he has other ways to monetise the site. Then the site almost runs out of money and adverts start to appear. Users are not happy, but they get it - someone has to keep the lights on. And this is *Tumblr* right, the last great internet free-for-all where you can post *anything* and that's all cool...

Except they ran out of money again. To me, Tumblr has simply never looked viable as a monetised platform. There is no denying that it is quirky, different, and has captured the imagination of a particular generation, or sub-generation, of internet users. The way in which it did this, however, was to be "different". Not only did it offer a different blogging paradigm (although it would be wrong to say that it *invented* tumblogging) but It also eschewed the normal controls on content, paid only lip service to identifying its users or maintaining any kind of control. In many ways, it behaved more like a protocol or a de-centralised service rather than what it was - a monolithic service provider.

Easy to use software, nice community features, and a certain zeitgeist magic. If Tumblr where an open source project that it would surely be a darling to put Wordpress to shame. But it isn't that, and that brings us back to this fact ... **They keep running out of money.**

And so... enter Yahoo! With its somehow cosmically deep pockets, Yahoo! come up with a bid for Tumblr that everyone accepts. The party can continue, because a rich benefactor rolled in a splashed some cash. But we've all seen this story before. There is not a single movie in which the young, partying people adopt a seemingly charming and "down with it" older person and utilise their money that does also feature a terrible comeuppance for said younglings. It's one of the oldest story tropes out there for a reason. The older benefactor *always* has an ulterior motive and the moral is always the same.

Kids, nothing is for nothing. There's no such thing as a free lunch and there's definitely no such thing as a free Tumblr.

Some pundits said that Yahoo! was trying to add some "cool" to its portfolio by buying Tumblr. Personally, I think they were trying to add revenue. Brands had been flocking to Tumblr to try and capture the attention of its audience, and where there's advertising there's money. Internet money. That thar internet money that's in them thar hills. Like a rubbish version of the Beverley Hillbillies, Yahoo! thought Tumblr was full of black gold and texas tea.

Sadly, it turns out Tumblr was mostly full of porn. *(Or at least 10% of it was, which makes it quite porn free in internet terms)*

It was inevitable that a corporate behemoth like Yahoo! would clamp down on the kind of content that users could have on Tumblr. And, in keeping with [Yahoo!'s promise not to "mess" with it](http://metro.co.uk/2013/05/21/tumblr-porn-can-stay-insists-yahoo-ceo-marissa-mayer-3802892/), they didn't kick the users off. They just made them all invisible to the internet, and to each other, and left them in some sort of digital oubliette to die. 

Kids, your adult and NSFW pics are not "brand safe" and Yahoo is all about the brands. The simple fact is this - Tumblr had it coming because you can't attract the big advertisers if there's a chance that their brand ends up next to someone's dodgy selfie.

Expect to hear Tumblr mentioned in same sarcastic tones as MySpace in eighteen months, and get ready to move on to the **next big thing**.
