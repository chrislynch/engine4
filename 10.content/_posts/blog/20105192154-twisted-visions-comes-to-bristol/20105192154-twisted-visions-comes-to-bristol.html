She's from Athens, she's slightly crazy (in the good way), and Rich McAuliffe and I have been fighting over her months. Brilliantly talented and producing a unique style of artwork, I've been lucky enough to work with Valia on the upcoming Insomnia "Survial" anthology and to get some behind the scenes peeks at her artwork for Rich's "Snow", also coming from Insomnia. She writes too, and she probably bakes. There's probably nothing she can't do.

So, why the outpouring of apprecation for this magician of the pens? Well, Valia has collected together the various short comic strips that she has worked on with a range of writers and collected them into <a href="http://neurotic-elf.deviantart.com/journal/32194472/">a short run anthology called "Twisted Visions"</a>. Featuring Kostas A, Rich McAuliffe, Panos Panagiotopoulos, Sissy Pantelis, and myself, it's 104 pages of some of the most original and exciting artwork you're going to see anywhere. If you were one of the people who signed up to our <span style="color: #ff0000;">"<strong><a href="http://www.facebook.com/group.php?gid=190668378067&amp;ref=ts">Valia Kapadai will kill you</a></strong>"</span> Facebook group, it is also your first chance to see the story "Hypergraphia" and to start plotting your revenge against me. Don't blame Valia, the world needs her more than it does me.

According to Valia's blog, there will only be 30 personalised copies, so make sure you search her out and pick one up. If you do miss out on Twisted Visions, try to pick up one of Valia's other books, they are all definitely worth your time and investment.
