I knew this some time back and it was at the front of my mind when I penned the short "The Clockwork Occultist", which I am delighted to be able to let you know will be included in this anthology. Victoriana is a favourite theme/meme of mine, so I'm pretty chuffed to be the first out of the gate with something for the 2011 Accent book, which will no doubt continue to be a "who's who" of UK talent.

"The Clockwork Occultist" is a tale of Victorian time travel, steam powered legs, very big guns, a hero, a villian, vampires, and Hitler ... <em>steampunk </em>Hitler ... being ably illustrated by a new partner in crime Terry Cooper. Terry has kindly sketched out page 1 for us, complete with some dialog to whet the appetite ...

So, keep your eyes peeled in 2011!

In the meantime don't forget that "The Law of Horus", by <a href="http://www.comicspace.com/nicwilkinson/">Nic Wilkinson</a> and I, will be featuring in the upcoming Accent anthology "Predators" in 2010.
