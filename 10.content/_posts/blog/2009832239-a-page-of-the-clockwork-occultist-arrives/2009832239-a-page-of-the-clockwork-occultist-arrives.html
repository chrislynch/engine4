#A Page Of The Clockwork Occultist Arrives.#

My inbox this week has been was replete with missives, but few so welcome as this page of artwork for The Clockwork Occultist from the very talented Mr. Terry Cooper.

Feast your oculars upon this, my beauties, and wish the days away between now and the release of Accent UK's Victoriana!
