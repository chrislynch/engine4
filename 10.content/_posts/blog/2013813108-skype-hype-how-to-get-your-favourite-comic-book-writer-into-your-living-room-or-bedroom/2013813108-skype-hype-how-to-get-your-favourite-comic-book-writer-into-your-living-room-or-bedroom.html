@Title:Skype Hype: How to get your favourite comic book writer into your living room (or bedroom)

Robot 6 are carrying an article about something called ["Skype Hype"](http://robot6.comicbookresources.com/2013/08/skype-hype-writers-innovate-cheaper-more-frequent-appearances/) an idea being kicked around by Steve Niles, Jimmy Palmiotti, and Ron Marz for "virtualising" convention appearances using tools like Skype and Google Hangouts.


The seed of the idea comes from the problem that many writers face when looking at the convention schedule: **conventions are damned expensive to do**.

As a writer, your opportunities to cover your costs (table, travel, accommodation, sustenance, etc.) are pretty limited. You won't have original artwork to sell, for one thing, and charging for sketches isn't an option either. I've tried to innovate with the idea of writing *flash fiction* at my table, but not everyone *gets it* and it doesn't have the draw of artwork. It's also an immense amount of pressure to put yourself under as a writer and I don't know anyone else who does this. Most of my writing peers think I'm an idiot (that's probably not *just* the flash fiction thing though). This isn't to say that artists, indie publishers, traders, or anyone else has it easy when it comes to covering their costs at a convention. There are even some conventions that lose money at the end of the day. Suffice it to say this - everyone *wants* conventions, both creators and fans, but *someone* has to pay for them. In the UK there seems to be a new convention announced every month and there are even more in my own home town (Cardiff) than I can manage to attend.

Is the convention bubble set to burst? Maybe. Whether it does or not, "Skype Hype" sounds like a great way for creators to connect with fans, retailers, and each other without the expense of a convention.

Essentially, Niles, Palmiotti and Marz are suggested scheduled webcasts to retailers or conventions. The host retailer or convention holds product, including pre-signed books etc., and the creator (or creators) are online at a pre-set time for the chat. Web chats like this are by no means new, but they are normally moderated/text based affairs. A live video conference with the creator from a pre-set location is something pretty exciting. It's also something well within the reach of most retailers to arrange. Get a webcam, internet connection, projector ... you're ready to go.

Of course, this also opens up the option of smaller and more intimate events. For comic book fans not blessed with the plethora of conventions that the UK or US have to offer, this could be a fantastic way of connecting for both creators and fans.

I, for one, think this is a great idea. It won't replace the real buzz of a convention - something strange happens down in the quantum space when you get that many comic book folk in a single place - but I'd certainly be interested in attending something like this on either side of the camera. I also wonder how many people Tom Hiddleston could control if Loki ever figures out Google+
