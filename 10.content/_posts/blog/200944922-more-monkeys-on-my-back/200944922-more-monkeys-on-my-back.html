@Title:More Monkeys On My Back

#More Monkeys On My Back#

Looks like I made the cut for the <a href="http://monkeyonmyback.squarespace.com/twitter-comic/">Monkey On My Back Twitter Comic</a>. Check out panel #10 for something typically MWM.

Wasn't entirely sure how this would work, both practically and in terms of the way the story would break down, but there is certainly something interesting happening.

What I would love to see is this being done on a larger scale now - with every response Tweet getting an illustration and creating a divergent path in the story. That sort of meta-fiction fascinates me, andI think it would be amazing to see the different storylines expand, cross, converge, and even merge towards the end.

I've been thinking about trying to build some kind of overall narrative into the <a href="http://www.tinyurl.com/mwmlive">Monkeys with Macineguns Live!</a> event based on this. I'm not sure if it will be possible, but certainly we'll be Twittering throughout the day, so if you can't make it to the show itself, be sure to <a href="http://www.twitter.com/chrislynch_mwm">follow us on Twitter</a> and see how we get on.
