@Title:When Mike The Knight Committed Genocide

In the disturbing world of CBeedbies, Mike the Knight is normally safe territory. Mike decides to have a "mission", screws it up by being selfish, learns a moral lesson, and puts things right at the end. Every episode his sword, enchanted by his sister Evie the witch, turns into whatever he is going to need to solve his problems. (*As yet, it has not turned into the ability to remember a moral lesson from one episode to another - it seems to tap out at becoming something like a fishing rod*).


In today's episode, however, things took a grim turn.

Through a typically convoluted chain of events, Evie turned some of Mike's toy knights into living, breathing copies of Mike. 

At was at this point that my well-honed sci-fi/fantasy radar went off as if an Independence Day saucer has just appeared overhead.

Evie, who has previously been unable to get a simple sword +1 enhancement correct, can now create life. **LIFE**. I know it's a kid's show, but the internal logic of the show somewhat broke down for me then.

Of course, it all went wrong and the ersatz Mikes ran amok. Mr. Blacksmith and Mrs. Piecrust (catch up with the show True Believer) suffered yet again at the hands of Mike's tyranny. Somewhere in this show there is a deeply concealed critique of the feudal system, I'm sure.

So, having decided to "Be a Knight, and Do it Right", Mike got Evie to turn the living, breathing copies of himself back into soldiers.

I'm not saying he was *wrong*, one Mike the Knight is annoying enough, but that was a whole new **lifeform** right there. And now it is gone. If this was an episode of Star Trek TNG I can guarantee there would have been some *pretty heated discussion* in the Ready Room about that move. 

The moral, in the end, was to take responsibility for your own chores.

Personally, I think the moral should have been "watch out for your sister, she wields god-like power".

Just sayin' ...
