@Title:Amazon Kindle For Writers - April 2013

Keeping tracks of the ups and downs of Amazon and its Kindle ecosystem is something every writer should be doing. Amazon and its Kindle are, in effect, a market in and of itself and if you're serious about selling copies your writing, Amazon is one of the biggest games in town.


April 2013 was a busy month for Amazon, here are the highlights.

## Amazon doesn't like Welsh or Cornish

Amazon has taken some flack for not supporting books written in Welsh or Cornish. Historically, it was possible to publish books in Welsh by filing them as "English", but with Amazon's software now checking the content of the books this is no longer possible. [Y Lolfa, a small publisher based near Aberystwyth, has been campaigning for Welsh to be an accepted language](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2013/04/15/wales_language_amazon/). Although a spokesman for Amazon claimed it is working on plans to offer the language in future, there was no definite timeline and it sounds like this argument might run and run.

Meanwhile, over in pixie territory, [Amazon have been engaged in a very public spat with the Cornish Language Board](http://www.guardian.co.uk/books/2013/apr/15/ebooks-amazon-diglot-kindle-language).

The reality here seems to be that Amazon have introduced a control over languages before it has introduced the technical ability to handle the breadth of languages that people want to publish in. The list of supported languages is actually pretty short. It seems people are prepared to fight, and fight hard, however for the right to publish - a clear indicator of how vital Amazon Kindle sales have become as part of most publisher's sales strategies.

If you're working on any new writing in a language that Amazon doesn't support *today*, you may need to consider whether Amazon Kindle sales can be a part of your immediate sales strategy.

## Amazon does like India

[Redington](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redington_(India)_Limited) has tied up a deal with Amazon to [distribute the Amazon Kindle in India](http://www.bgr.in/news/redington-starts-distributing-amazons-kindle-devices-in-india/)

Before you decide that this doesn't matter for *you*, take a look at this 2011 article that predicts that [India will become the largest market for English books within 10 years](http://www.thenational.ae/news/world/south-asia/publishers-get-a-measure-of-indias-booming-english-book-market).

Amazon's push into this territory is significant and could represent a new, hungry market for eBooks.

## Amazon REALLY likes comics (and maybe pirates)

Without a great deal of fanfare, Amazon also rolled its tanks across Comixology's borders with the release of the [Kindle Comic Creator](http://www.amazon.com/gp/feature.html/?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&docId=1001103761&linkCode=ur2&tag=richjohnston-20) this month.

Allowing you to create .mobi files of comics to publish via Kindle either from image files *or by extracting images from ePub files*, the launch of this software should send shivers down the spines of other digital comics vendors. The Amazonian leviathan is stirring Comixology... you're going to need a bigger boat.

It will be interesting to see if any non-comics creators are drawn in by the features of the Kindle Comic Creator as well. Will we see panel-view enabled children's books, instruction manuals, or educational titles? Watch this space...

As an aside, this software does also seem to open up the world of digital comics piracy a little as well. Expect to see a shift from .CBR to panel-view enabled .mobi files in the Usenet groups (not that I go there, it's just what I hear).
