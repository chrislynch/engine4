@Title:New Website New Cms

# New website, new CMS


If you are reading this, you are looking at the **all new Planet of the Penguins**.

It has an all new *"design"* (if you can call my minimal approach to typography and colour a design) but, more importantly, an all new CMS.

The CMS powering this website is the [engine4](http://www.engine4.net) CMS pattern, a "bare bones" CMS that I built to illustrate how you build a CMS using engine4. I hope that by using this CMS as *my* day-to-day CMS I will find all the kinks, issues, bugs, and problems not only in the CMS pattern but also in the framework itself. I'm a big advocate of the ["dog fooding"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) process, so I've laid myself up a big meal right here.

The other important new thing is that there will be **new content**. One of my big objections to Wordpress, and the major reason that I have stripped it out of my website, is that I felt it got in my way. I am a relentless and unashamed "tweaker"; I like to play with how my website works and what it looks like just as much as I like to write content for it. Wordpress didn't make this easier for me. If anything, the fact that I couldn't get the result that I wanted meant that I sacrificed to tweaking Wordpress when I should have/could have been writing.

So, if this is the only post on this blog then the experiment has failed. The engine4 CMS pattern has eaten up all my spare time and I have not written one jot. If, however, this post has vanished down into the bowels of the site, then things are working.

I'll be blogging here about every step of each process - my quest to create a perfect writer's CMS, my quest to write and publish more this year than ever before, and the curious intersection between technology, creativity, writing, and productivity that seems to be my "beat".

See you next time. Assuming there is one...
