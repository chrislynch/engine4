@Title:Alternative Press Anthology Book

#Alternative Press Anthology Book?#

Over at the <a href="http://comicsandzines.wordpress.com/2009/02/02/what-a-fantastic-day/">Alternative Press Fair Blog</a>, Jimi and Peter are putting forward the notion of an Alternative Press Anthology Book.

As a long time advocate of the anthology and alternative content therein, I suppose I should get my skates on and contribute! After all, I am nothing if not <em>glittery</em> (that will only make sense when you read their post ...).
