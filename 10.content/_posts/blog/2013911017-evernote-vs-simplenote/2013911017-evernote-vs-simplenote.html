Tools for Writers: SimpleNote &amp; Evernote


Every writer I know has notebooks. They live in pockets, they live in satchels and go-bags. Some are posh, expensive, and luxurious. Others are just... pads. It doesn't matter, what's important is that they should always be to hand. You never know when inspiration is going to strike, especially if you've got your eyes and ears open.

Working with pen (or pencil) and paper is an essential part of my process. It eliminates the barriers that working in a word processor or text editor can introduce and, importantly, my notepad doesn't receive emails. I can't tweet from a Bic, either. Pen and paper is still, for me, the ultimate tool for working out just about any problem, a tricky plot included. Pen and paper can accept any form of data, doesn't need to be charged up, and never crashes. My notebooks tend to be [hypergraphic](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypergraphy) and pen and paper is perfect for this.

But, even as a devotee of the pen and paper method as I am, I don't carry a notepad and pen everywhere. It's actually not that practical. One thing I never, ever leave behind however is my *phone*.

Since the advent of smartphones, there has been an explosive growth in the number of note taking, to-do, and list making apps. The most famous of these is probably Evernote.

Evernote has many desirable features. It accepts text, picture, and audio notes. Your notes are search-able, accessible on multiple platforms (including your phone), and there are a ton of apps that can connect to your notebooks to use, or add to, your Evernote notes. Evernote provides this for free, as long as you stay within their restrictions on how many notes you can create and how much data you can push.

Sounds perfect, right? An infinite notebook, connected to your phone, that you can then access on your computer to act on all those brilliant ideas you had whilst you were out and about.

But, I've got a problem or two with Evernote.

Carrying a notebook everywhere can be a problem though.
