<strong>MONKEYS WITH MACHINEGUNS OFFER A VISION OF THE FUTURE AT BRISTOL COMIC CON
</strong>
Monkeys with Machineguns are producing an extremely limited number of promotional comic books to accompany the Monkeys with Machineguns Live event at the Small Press Expo in Bristol on May 9th.

While stocks last anyone buying a unique, one off illustrated short story from Chris and Stu will receive it mounted inside a copy of the limited edition twenty page book. Featuring not only an eight page preview of their upcoming book “The Magpye”, being published by Markosia, but also a full colour eight page preview of a brand new secret project, this is an opportunity for those taking part in Monkeys with Machineguns Live to own a small part of the future of comic book history.

For those not in the know, the Magpye is a “supernatural superhero psychological horror story”, a genre-bending tale of an amnesiac vigilante charged with defending mankind from monsters, creatures, and things that lurk in the dark whilst being haunted, and sometimes hounded, by the ghosts of his fallen predecessors. When the Magpye’s identity is finally revealed however, he may have to face the worst monster of all … himself.

As for the secret project … the details of that will be revealed at the show!
