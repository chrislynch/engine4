@Title:The Man In The Tall Hat

#The Man In The Tall Hat#

She was a kid, a girl, someone's baby. Not a dame, or a broad, or a skirt. And not the kind of girl you expected to see this side of town, where the wild things were.

But there she was. There she was with her blond hair dyed orange by dried blood. There her teeth where, smashed and scattered around like a broken daisy chain. There she lay, dead and bloody and blond and still someone's kid, even if right now nobody cared.

"Another one," grumbled the beat cop, the dead girl at his feet as inconvenient to him as a cold cup of coffee. "Whoever this guy is, he's racking 'em up alright. What was she, prostitute?"

The detective squatted down next to the body, flicking the dead girl's hair back with the end of a well chewed pen.

"Don't recognise her," he said, impassively. "I'll ask the boys in vice, see if they know her."

"Hah, yeah. Maybe one of them was a regular, eh?" joked the cop. He pulled a boiled sweet from his pocket and unwrapped it noisily. "Always fancied vice myself, you know? From what I've heard ..."

"I wouldn't know," said the detective, interrupting the cop. Watching from the alleyway opposite, Harry smiled. Maybe there were still a few good police in the city. Not that having a good heart gave you a good head, but it was a start if nothing else. Harry continued to watch as the detective poked and prodded, made notes with his well chewed pen in a dog-eared notepad, and ignored the cop's attempts to engage him a conversation about the relative "perks" of working in vice.

Harry heard the rain drum its wet fingertips on the brim of his top hat before he felt it.

"Cover her up," said the detective. "Looks like the forensics boys are going to be a while."

The cop took of his uniform jacket, grumbling, and tossed it carelessly across the girl. It covered her body and head, leaving her pale, bare legs exposed to the rain. The rainwater ran underneath her body, and brought tiny rivulets of diluted blood trickling down her thighs. "I suppose you expect me to just stand here in me shirtsleeves then?" asked the cop, sarcastically. "I'll catch my bloody death."

"I'll wait, you knock off for the night. Sight like this, I'm sure you need some time to get over it, right?" It was a clumsy gambit, but the cop wasn't the type to pick up on subtlety. A hint needed to hit him square between the eyes.

"Yeah, yeah," the cop replied, crunching the sweet as if it had the idea in its centre. "I should probably, you know, get some help ... or something. See someone, you know, about the stress?"

"Post ... traumatic ... stress ... disorder," the detective said, slowly enough that even the cop's brain could record the words. "Friend of mine found a dead hobo in a bin once, folded up like a five pound note. Got six grand compensation, cushy desk job when he got back too. Rest of the guys spent the next six months checking every bin they passed."

The cop nodded slowly. "Yeah ... yeah."

The detective looked at him, raising an eyebrow. He all but nudged him. Harry stifled a chuckle. Some people had so little imagination. 

"So, I should probably go then," said the cop. The final safety checks. This was happening. The detective was sending him on his way, no questions asked. Take a break. Have a freebie. Top up the pension fund with a little handout from the city. You've had a bad day.

The detective didn't answer, just grunted and squatted back down over the dead girl. The only other witness to this tiny crime of corruption, she wasn't going to say anything. Harry watched as the cop slunk away, his pace quickening as he put some distance between him, the detective, and the dead girl that was his ticket to a fat payout and a cushy desk job. He got in his car, fired up the engine, and raced off into the wet night.

Harry waited until he was around the corner and out of sight before crossing the road. He tipped his top hat to the detective in greeting.

"You took your time," complained the detective.

"Been watching," replied Harry. "Watching you play shove haypenny with our friends slow brain. What a regrettably small brain he must have, rattled around in that cavernous head."

The detective snapped his fingers. It was hard to keep Harry on topic. His mind wandered like litter in the breeze. "And speaking of heads?"

Harry looked down as the detective pulled the cop's raid sodden coat back from the girl's body. Her head had rolled to one side, a glassy eye staring up into the rain. Harry ran his eyes across the gap between head and body, the tattered edges of the neck curling in the rain.

"Oh yes, yes, that's his work. Cut cut, snap, snap. The Queen has been here with her chief chopper of heads."

The detective rubbed his eyes. 

"I guessed that much," he said. "We've managed to keep this out of the papers for now, so a copycat isn't likely. Not yet, anyway."

"I knew a cat once," replied Harry. "If this is him and not the Queen, you'll never catch him."

"No, I mean a copycat. Someone copying what the Queen is doing."

"Oh, she wouldn't stand for that."

The detective looked at Harry. Mad Harry, Harry the Hatter. At first he hadn't believed that he was real, hadn't believed any of it was real.
