@Title:Timebomb Monologue

#Timebomb Monologue#

Timebomb Monologue was the second story that I contributed to the Monkeys with Machineguns <strong>Hammer of Time</strong> anthology.
<blockquote>“I see you have locked the study door again. Is the boy to live on bread and water forever?”

“What would you suggest father?” asked Joshua, his eyes fixed on his plate, “That I take a hunting crop to his legs?”

Joshua’s father’s cruel eyes flashed as he skewered a quivering piece of fish from his plate.

“It worked on you,” he said darkly, popping the cold flesh into his mouth.</blockquote>
