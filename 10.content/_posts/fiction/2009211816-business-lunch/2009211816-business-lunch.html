<blockquote>Hello.

My name is Katie and I am nine years old. You don’t have a name yet because you are just my imaginary friend. I wish I had real friends, but you will have to do. I’m locked in a box at the moment you see, and I don’t think anyone else will fit in here with me.

I’ve been here for a few hours, I think. I’m not sure how I got to be in this box, although I am quite sure that I used to know. When I first woke up I was very scared, and very hungry. I felt like I had been asleep for a hundred years. Its very dark in here and I can’t really see very much. I found a piece of cake on the floor of my box as I moved around, I ate it, and since then I have been forgetting more things that I can remember.

I think I used to have real friends, and a family, but I can’t be certain. For all I know, I might always have lived in this box and that might be quite normal. Perhaps I banged my head, rolling around in my sleep, and now my brain is all wrong. I’ve heard that can happen, but I’m not sure where. I wish you could tell me what you think.

There are noises outside the box. Things bang, click, clank, and thud. I hear voices often, although mostly they are muffled and far away. Sometimes I box feels like it is being moved, as if there are things behind it that someone wants to get to. The voices say bad things then, and I try not to listen. I don’t think I am a nuisance, I am very quiet in my box and disturb no-one. Still, the voice says that I will be gone soon, and so I try not to worry. I am sure wherever I am going will be much more convenient for everyone.

Anyway, I wanted you to be here because I’ve heard one voice say that friends are coming to have tea with it. It’s a croaky voice, like an old lady who has swallowed a toad and can’t get it all the way down her throat. The voice is very excited, and it sings to itself amongst the rattles and clanks and hisses and bubbles somewhere outside my box. I don’t recognise the language that the songs are in.

Seeing as the voice was having friends around, I thought it was only fair that I did too. The voice doesn’t seem to want to ask me what I want to do. Another voice arrived just before you did. This one is a man’s voice, it rolls around outside the box like thunder. I think the croaky one said that another friend was coming as well. I hope their voice is not as loud as the new man’s voice. He frightens me a bit.

If you look up, you can see the odd shadow moving on the lid of the box. I suppose a little light must creep in between the cracks, though not enough to see by. I’ve searched for more cake, I think it is very rude to have nothing to offer your guest, but I am afraid that the box seems to be empty except for you and me.

I think the voices have food. If you listen carefully, you can hear the sound of plates being put down on top of the box. I wish I could see what they are eating. I can smell warm cakes, fresh from the oven. I don’t know how I know the smell, perhaps it is one of things that I haven’t forgotten yet, although I seem to have already forgotten how I know it. Things are very confusing in the box. Perhaps you can remember some things for me?

Of course you can’t because you are just imaginary. Perhaps I can imagine that you remember them, and that will help me to remember.

The voices are speaking again, can you hear what they are saying?

“Did you give it to him?” the croaky one says.

“Of course,” says the booming one. His voice is so loud, can you feel how it rattles the box?

“Did you get a fair price?”

“For a super-bowl touchdown? My dear, you know how important the stupidest things can be to them. There is only one price that is fair.”

“Been a while since I had a fresh, young soul. Most of the people I get in here trying to sell theirs have already worn them practically through, and I didn’t think the young ones still even believed nowadays.”

“I believe the young man had the benefit of a religious upbringing.”

They are laughing now. I don’t understand what’s so funny. Perhaps I can’t remember how jokes work.

There’s a tinkling noise far away, a tiny bell. Can you hear the footsteps? I think this is the third voice come for tea.

“Hello Miranda,” says the croaky one.

“Hello.”

The one who says “Hello” back has a soft voice. I like it much better than the others. I don’t dare to speak, but I hope my voice would sound like that one if I did. I can’t remember what my own voice sounds like. Is that quite normal do you think?

“Greetings.”

That’s the booming one. He sounds pleased to see this new one.

“Am I too late?”

“Not at all Miranda, we were just pouring the tea.”

“Nettle?”

“Blackberry.”

“Ooh splendid.”

“I got a bag of it from a warlock, traded those old cat skins that I’ve had laying around for ages.”

“What on earth did he want those for?”

“I don’t think he was going to use them on Earth dear.”

“Ah, I see. Do you think you should have sold them to him then?”

“Oh I don’t see the harm. After all, how many warlocks do you know who come back from that trip?”

“Warlocks? Oh,well … none!”

Can you hear them all laughing again? I don’t understand what they are talking about, but if it is making the booming one laugh then I just know that it is something bad. I’m sorry I made you come here, because I don’t think this is a good place anymore.

The croaky one is asking questions now.

“How’s business your end?”

“Oh you know, Valentine’s coming up, so I’m getting lots of new people through the door looking for advice.”

“Ah, love spells.”

“Actually, Cupid seems to be more into curses than charms this year. I’m advising young lovers not to make any long-term plans.”

“Very wise, very wise.”

Are you still there? It’s gotten darker in here, I don’t know how because it was so dark before, but it is definitely darker now. I think the booming one is standing up now; I feel cold, as if something is blocking out wherever my warmth was coming from. Don’t ask me how I know, but his shadow has fallen me and my little box. Can you feel it? Tell me, please, that you can feel it.

The plates are moving again. They don’t seem to have had them there long enough to eat very much at all. Perhaps they were just having afternoon tea, a drink and a slice of cake before doing whatever it is that they do in the afternoon. The shadows that were where the plates were aren’t disappearing, even though I am sure the plates are being taken away. I can hear them clattering into a sink, and the sound of running water. What is it that you do with plates when they are dirty?

“Shall we open it up then?”

The booming one is speaking, and he sounds much closer now. I thought he was just outside the box before, but now he sounds so much closer and louder, as if there was something more than just the walls of the box between him and me before. Now I know for certain that there is only the lid of this box between me and booming man. I am very afraid, and wish I hadn’t brought you here, even though it will be nice to have someone with me when I meet him. Would you hold my hand?

We’ll have to close our eyes soon, because I hear them opening the the box, and it’s sure to be bright outside. I think it is nailed shut, they are using something long and metal that pokes in underneath the lid as they try and prise it open.

“Lid’s on tight,” says the croaky one. “She’s a little bigger than usual, a real find.”

“Excellent,” says the booming one.

“What fun.”

Keep your eyes closed. Keep your eyes closed. I can feel the light coming in, it’s so bright, it’s making my eyelids burn. Keep your eyes closed, hold my hand. I’m sorry I never had time to name you. I think I probably would have forgotten your name anyway, because I can’t really remember anything now.

My name is Katie, and I am nine years old, but when I look into the big black eyes of the booming man I can see my reflection and I look a lot older. His face is bright red, and his mouth is full of jagged yellow teeth. He has long, pointed ears that twitch when I open my mouth to speak, and a tongue that pokes out at me when he realises I can’t think of anything to say.

“Hello Katie.” says the booming man.

I’m going to let go of your hand now, because I don’t want him to know that you are here.

“How old is she?”

I can’t turn around to see what the honey-voiced one looks like. I can’t take my eyes off the booming man, and the naked girl staring back at me from inside his giant black eyes.

“Her driver’s license says she’s eighteen this month. I caught her trying to steal a book this morning.” It is the croaking one that replies. She is behind me as well, just a shadow looming in the eyes of the booming man.

“Another one of your familiars?” asks honey-voice.

“Oh no, not one of mine. I’ve seen her around, but no potential to speak of. She didn’t even know not to eat the memnos-cake I left in there with her.”

“Ah, I was wondering how you’d kept her so quiet.”

“And so afraid,” adds the booming man with a smile that looks like a row of gravestones. “There’s nothing less palatable than defiant meat.”

“I’d say she’s lost almost ten years in there,” says the crone. There’s pride in her voice.

“If only there was something like that for our old frames, eh Gerta?”

The crone and honey-voice laugh together.

“This one looks good enough to eat though,” says the booming man.

“Our thoughts exactly,” coo the others.

And then they all laugh together. I think I know why.</blockquote>
