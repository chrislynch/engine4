#Forces Of Geek Review The Dark#

<a href="http://twitter.com/richclements">Rich Clements</a> (he of Hi Ex, FutureQuake, and Turning Tiger fame) has <a href="http://www.forcesofgeek.com/2010/03/idea-factory.html">reviewed The Dark for the Forces of Geek website</a>.
<blockquote><span>Early on, just as I was settling into the groove, Lynch pulled the rug from under me in a glorious and unexpected way. Which is impressive enough to do once, but he manages to do it another two or three times throughout the book.

The plotting in dense and impressively done. The writing is multi-layered and clever and demands that the reader pays attention (this is a good thing, by the way).</span></blockquote>
<span>As Rich himself would say ... "Thank Grud it's good".</span>
