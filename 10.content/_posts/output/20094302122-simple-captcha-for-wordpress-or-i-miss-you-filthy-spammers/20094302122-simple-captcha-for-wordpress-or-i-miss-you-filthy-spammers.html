@Title:Simple Captcha For Wordpress Or I Miss You Filthy Spammers

		   #Simple CAPTCHA For Wordpress Or I Miss You Filthy Spammers#
My days of having to clear somwhere in the region of 100 spam comments out of my blog every day are gone. I have finally implemented a "captcha" on the comment form, thus disbarring all bots, robos, script kiddies, and general spamming malcontents. If you want to offer me a larger penis, perkier breasts, or a longer last erection you will now need to do it in person, or at the very least read the captcha.

There are a number of captcha modules available for Wordpress. I went for <a href="http://blog.zorex.info/?page_id=2">Simple CAPTCHA</a> , as a simple, "no frills" option. Installation is nothing more than FTP-ing the files to your plugins directory and switching it on. Instant captcha, instant zero pending comments for me.

I must confess, there is a little part of me that is sad to see them go. A very little part. <em>Maybe I should have read those adverts after all ...</em> ;-)
