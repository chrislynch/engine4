		   #Google Maps Being Used To Track H1N1 Swine Flu#
Firstly, I can't decide if this <a href="http://maps.google.com/maps/ms?ie=UTF8&amp;hl=en&amp;t=p&amp;msa=0&amp;msid=106484775090296685271.0004681a37b713f6b5950&amp;ll=32.639375,-110.390625&amp;spn=15.738151,25.488281&amp;z=5">H1N1 Swine Flu map on Google Maps</a> is useful, ingenious, or just macabre.

But this is the internet, which means it doesn't <em>have</em><span style="font-style: normal;"> to be, and probably </span><em>isn't</em><span style="font-style: normal;">.</span></p>
<p style="margin-bottom: 0cm;">I can't help but wonder what other kinds of map you could create with Google Maps if you wanted to whip up a bit of mass panic? The now infamous “<a href="http://spod.cx/bnp_members_list.shtml">BNP Membership Map</a>” being a case in point, I just wonder how long it will be before we have the “zombie infestation map” online. And how long after that until some lazy journalist turns it into news ...</p>
