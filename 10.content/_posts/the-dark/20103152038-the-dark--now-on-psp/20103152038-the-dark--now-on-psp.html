As of March 25th The Dark will available for download in four installments to your PSP. All of the installments have the same release date, so you will be able to pick up the equivalent of the entire trade from day one.The Dark is taking  pride of place alongside Markosia's critically acclaimed "Dark Mists" as the first Markosia titles to launch on the platform. Markosia were also able to reveal today that The Dark is also one of two Markosia titles that have been signed up exclusively by Sony for the platform!

‘These are exciting times for us,’ says publisher Harry Markos, ‘there is no denying that the digital comic is here to stay and it will have a major say over the next year or two. We are delighted to be partnering with Sony in this venture and from what I have seen so far; this is very much an exciting step forward. The graphics look amazing on PSP, crystal clear and surprisingly user-friendly thanks to the Autoflow feature.’

For those who remember the early days of "The Dark" as a project, digital was always a key medium for us, and I'm delighted that Sony have put their weight behind us by signing the project exclusively.

I'll see you all on the Playstation forums!
