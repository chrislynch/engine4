@Title:Bubble Zero Point One

The response to the annoucement of Version 0.0 of Bubble was better than I ever expected, with great feedback and suggestions coming in from comic book writers who have already been putting the language to the test in the real world.


One of the features consistently asked for was **panel counts** - a function by which Bubble would update the page headings (PAGE 1, PAGE 2, etc.) with the number of panels in the page itself. 

I've added this to the Bubble code today, and am very happy to have version 0.1 ready for writers to try.
