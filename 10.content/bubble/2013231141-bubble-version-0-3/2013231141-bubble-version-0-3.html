@Title:Bubble Version 0 3

I am very pleased to be posting up so soon after the first release of Bubble that Version 0.3 is now online and available.


I am very much indebted to all the comics writers, artists, letters, and more who have left comments, Facebook posts, tweets, or emails for me with feedback on the project so far. Without this feedback, Version 0.3 would look very different.

## Get Started with Bubble 0.3

Just click the [Bubble Web Application](app/bubble) link to get started.

## What's New in Bubble 0.3

### New User Interface

First and foremost, the web interface to Bubble has been significantly upgraded. Rather than leaving the "Dingus" interface trapped in the main website theme, I am now using a much cleaner application-style theme to present the editor. The interface is based on the [Benevolent Dictator Application Theme](https://github.com/jwynia/BenevolentDictator).

Other than the plain text editor, the app now just has a clean header and a sidebar containing a quick reference for the Bubble Markup. Future versions will extend this interface to, hopefully, include file handling functions to push and pull scripts from online storage and local files.

### New output format

When formatting a piece of Bubble Markup, the output now pops up in its own window (or tab) for ease of printing, saving, or copy & pasting into your editor of choice.

### New Markup for Bold, Italic, and Underlining

As requested by a few of the brave users of Bubble Version 0.1, the markup now includes syntax for bold, italic, and underlining that can be used in dialogue and panel descriptions. The syntax for this replicates the syntax found in Markdown.

I hope you all enjoy using Version 0.3 and find the new features useful.

As always, any and all feedback is gratefully received.
