@Title:Bubble Version 0 5 Released

Bubble Version 0.5 is now live at [app/bubble](app/bubble). Many thanks to the people who have shared their own script formats with me to help improve Bubble and have given me their feedback. I am hoping to have multiple formats available by Version 1.0, so you will be able to choose your perfect format for converting your Bubble script and be able to change formats without changing your plain-text file.


Ah, such dreams!

In the meantime, here's ...

## What's New In Bubble 0.5

### Tabbed, rather than centered

A few people have pointed out that the center aligned formatting of the character names and dialogues didn't match any standard formats, so I have replaced this with a more "tabbed" approach.

### Less white space

Bubble is less wasteful with white space now, outputting fewer paragraph breaks to produce a tighter script.

### Control over uppercase and mixed case dialogue

For those who don't like all their characters shouting all the time, there is now an option to leave your dialogue in the case that you write it.

### Speech Bubble Numbering

As requested by several of the early adopters, Bubble now numbers your speech bubbles on a per-page basis.

### Public and Private Comments

To help with drafting, and replicate the "notes" functionality of more advanced editors, Bubble now has formats for public and private comments.

You can add a private comment, which will be excluded from the final formatted version but will appear in your plain-text, or you can create a shared comment that will appear in your formatted script. Both use a simple single character prefix, so it is easy to add, remove, and share comments.
