<strong>Quite simply, it looks fantastic!</strong>

Sadly I can't preview much of the art here without blowing the story, but hopefully my gushing praise for Rick's work and the <a title="Click here to see Rick Lundeens art on &quot;The Escape Artist&quot;" href="2009/02/11/rick-lundeen-confirmed-on-the-escape-artist/">small sample we <em>can</em> make available</a> will convince you to seek this story out when it appears in a future issue of <a href="http://www.murkydepths.com/">Murky Depths</a>.

Rick and I are now talking about partnering up for some new projects in the future, so hopefully I will have the opportunity to wax lyrical about his artwork again soon.
