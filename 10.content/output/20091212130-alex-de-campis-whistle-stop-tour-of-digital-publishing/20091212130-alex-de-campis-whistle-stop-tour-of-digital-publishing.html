@Title:Alex De Campis Whistle Stop Tour Of Digital Publishing

		   #Alex De Campi's Whistle Stop Tour Of Digital Publishing#
Digital publishing is fast becoming the norm for comic book publishers, particularly for independents, the "small press", and individual creators such as myself.

However, taking your comic onto the 'net, mobile phones, eBook readers, etc. presents a whole new world of options and challenges for publishers and an almost bewildering list of platforms and partners to deal with. My own work has so far spread across <a href="http://ax.search.itunes.apple.com/WebObjects/MZSearch.woa/wa/search?entity=software&amp;media=all&amp;page=1&amp;restrict=false&amp;startIndex=0&amp;term=markosia">iTunes</a>, <a href="http://www.myebook.com/chrislynch/">myebook.com</a>, mobiles via the <a href="http://www.clickwheel.net/features/165">ClickWheel</a> platform, and is available as a <a href="http://www.indyplanet.com/store/product_info.php?products_id=382">digital comic from IndyPlanet</a> and yet I feel I have barely scratched the surface of this fascinating new marketplace.

Thankfully, some creators and publishers are blazing a trail for others to follow. Notable amongst these is Alex De Campi, who has kindly laid out her breadcrumb trail for us in this article on Bleeding Cool - <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com/2009/11/09/uncanny-valleygirl-by-alex-de-campi-5-be-my-guinea-pigs/">Uncanny Valleygirl by Alex De Campi #5: Be My Guinea Pigs!</a>

The article is a fascinating read and should be the start of any digital publisher's "to do" list.
