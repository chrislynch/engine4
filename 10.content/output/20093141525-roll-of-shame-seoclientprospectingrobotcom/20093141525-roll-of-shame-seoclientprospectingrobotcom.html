@Title:Roll Of Shame: Seoclientprospectingrobotcom

		   #Roll Of Shame: Seoclientprospectingrobot.com#
Oh dear oh dear.

I have received some comment spam today that I found so amusingly clumsy that I have decided it deserves something more than my usual "hit the spam button in Wordpress and sigh" response.

Today, we have our inaugural member of the Planet of the Penguins Roll of Shame.

<strong>Congratulations <a title="Click this link to share in their shame" href="http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com" target="_blank">www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com</a></strong>

The spam comment was attached to my article "<a href="2009/02/03/how-to-haikuhow-to-haiku/">How To Haiku</a>" and ran as follows:
<blockquote>This might be a little off subject, but have you looked at seoclientprospectingrobot dot com? Just wondering if you have any reviews of it, I’m thinking of buying a copy, and wanted to see if anyone had bought a copy yet.</blockquote>
OK, so what's wrong with this piece of comment spam and why do think it is particularly worthy of ridicule?

	<li>"It might be a little off subject"

Yes, it certainly is. About forty thousand leagues away from the actual topic of the post in fact. There is no conceivable link between the post and the comment. This is either lazy spamming or spamming that tried <em>not</em> to be lazy but went very, very wrong when confronted with my post.

Somewhere between 0 and 5 out of 10 for effort, 0 out of 10 for effectiveness <strong><a title="Click this link to share in their shame" href="http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com" target="_blank">www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com</a>.

	<li>It is using "black hat" SEO techniques to advertise SEO software that may or may not itself be sporting a dark chapeau

Spamming blogs that allow public comments, like this one, is a common "black hat" SEO practice; designed to inject links into sites and thus increase the page rank and perceived relevance of the target site. Search engine spiders see the link, or mention of the link, from my site to <strong><a title="Click this link to share in their shame" href="http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com" target="_blank">www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com</a> </strong>and then count that as a "vote" for that site, improving its search engine position.

Spam links, therefore, attempt to abuse this very democratic system of links=votes by creating links automatically.
<strong><a title="Click this link to share in their shame" href="http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com" target="_blank">
</a></strong>So<strong>, </strong>I have to say there is a certain irony in finding a spam comment that is trying to improve the search engine position of a web page about software that ... improves your search engine position. Irony, and no small amount of annoyance. Nice try <a title="Click this link to share in their shame" href="http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com" target="_blank"><strong><a title="Click this link to share in their shame" href="http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com" target="_blank">www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com</a></strong></a></li>
</ol>
So, not a very good effort overall. Really ... quite, quite poor.

I must point out at this point in time that I don't know if the software available from <strong><a title="Click this link to share in their shame" href="http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com" target="_blank">www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com</a> </strong>was used to commit this crime against intelligence<a title="Click this link to share in their shame" href="http://www.seoclientprospectingrobot.com" target="_blank">,</a> or if perhaps it was the work of someone else. <a href="mailto:seo4u@live.com">You would have to ask Sophie, via seo4u@live.com</a>, who originally posted the comment. Allegedly.

Best of luck in your next job Sophie.

Chris out.
