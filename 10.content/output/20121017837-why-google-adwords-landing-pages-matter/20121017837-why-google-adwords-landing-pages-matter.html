@Title:Why Google Adwords Landing Pages Matter

		   #Why Google Adwords Landing Pages Matter#
Since my <a href="http://www.ecommercecentric.co.uk/blog/2012-10-15.Changes_to_Adwords_Policy_and_What_You_Should_Do_Today">last blog on Google Adwords policy</a>, I've been digging deeper into the Adwords strategies of some Tier 1 retailers to see who is following the rules, and who isn't.

In my latest blog post for eCommerce Centric "<a href="http://www.ecommercecentric.co.uk/blog/2012-10-16.Adwords_Part_Two_-_Making_Landing_Pages_Relevant">Making Landing Pages Relevant for Google Adwords</a>", I've explored the very real problem of "bait and switch" adverts - adverts that say one thing, then deliver another. I have been staggered by how many major retailers (<em>Disclaimer: None of which are clients) </em>don't seem to have a handle on their Adwords campaigns. What has started to really frustrate me is that I am starting to see these poorly configured adverts not as just a waste of money by the people paying for them, but as a disservice to me as a customer and consumer.

Google <strong>do</strong> have somewhere that you can <a href="http://support.google.com/adwords/bin/request.py?contact_type=feedback">report adverts that violate Google Adwords policies</a>, which would now include ads that don't take you to the products they were advertising, but it is buried three or four clicks deep in their support pages. It makes you wonder if Google really care when consumers are misdirected, or if their real reward is in users hitting "back" and moving on to the next advert.

Of course, as I point out in my blog, Google are in the business of <strong>relevant search results.</strong> Of course they care if poor adverts start to cost them market share, or make people less likely to trust adwords, but I think the "penalty" for violation won't show itself as adverts being blocked and accounts being shut. It is far more likely, I think, that Google will hit violators in the pocket with higher costs per click.

All of which, ultimately, is good for the little guy who plays by the rules ... <em>eventually.</em>
