		   #How To Fix Android Dialer Storage And Lost Internet Access.#
A lot of Android users are complaining online about Android's Dialer storage application using up too much space. Struggling for space on my HTC Desire, I cleared my dialer storage today.

As best I can work out, Dialer Storage is where Android text messages, picture messages, and call history are stored. There are notes on-line complaining is a long standing bug in Android that allows the data in Dialer Storage to run amok, eating up your Android phone's precious internal storage. Turning down the limits on message storage doesn't seem to produce a quick fix, as much as it looks like it should.

Clearing Dialer Storage data, through the Android Application Manager initially appeared to do nothing, other than clear the warning about limited space from my home screen. All my text messages and photo messages seemed to have survived as well. So, where did the space go?

Well, my messages did eventually disappear after I restarted my phone, so I guess these were maybe hanging about either in memory or in some sort of deleted state, cleared on my reboot. What was less obvious was that clearing dialer storage also deactivated my internet access point selection. My access point configuration was still in place, but my choice of default access point had been lost.

If you lose Internet access after clearing Android Dialer Storage, here's a fix.
<ol>
	<li>Go to <strong>Settings</strong></li>
	<li>Go to <strong>Wireless &amp; Networks</strong></li>
	<li>Scroll down and select <strong>Mobile Networks</strong></li>
	<li>Click <strong>Access Point Names</strong></li>
	<li>Click on the empty circle next to access point name, turning it green.</li>
</ol>
Your Android internet access should now be restored.
