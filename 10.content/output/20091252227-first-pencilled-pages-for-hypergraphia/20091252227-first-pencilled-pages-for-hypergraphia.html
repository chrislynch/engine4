@Title:First Pencilled Pages For Hypergraphia

		   #First Pencilled Pages For Hypergraphia#
<p style="text-align: left;">I received the first pencilled pages yesterday for my new Insomnia story "Hypergraphia" this week, drawn by the very talented Valia.</p>

As always, I've had a great time going overboard with the research.

I'm hoping Valia will have time to include some cameos from my writing alumni, as there is room for plenty of extras. Of course, as this is one of <em>my</em> stories, and Insomnia seem to be foolishly giving me free reign <em>again ... </em>they may not be so please to be included as will be to see them there.

I've put some simple letters over Valia's pencils, so you can get a bit more of a feel for what the story is all about.
