@Title:Comic books and Copyright: The Never Ending Battle

[Will Pickering, the artist behind Burke and Hare, has publicly called out Marvel](http://willpickering.blogspot.co.uk/) for stepping on his "Agents of T.I.M.E" mark with their ["Indestructible Hulk" announcement at SDCC](http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&id=46650).


Although this is news for Will and Marvel (probably less so for Marvel, sorry Will!) it's certainly nothing new in the world of comics.

Whether it be landmark cases such as Siegel and Schuster vs. DC & Warner Brothers for the rights to Superman, creator vs. creator disputes such as [Tony Moore vs. Rob Kirkman for the rights to The Walking Dead](http://www.newsarama.com/comics/kirkman-moore-walking-dead-lawsuit-120209.html), or Stan Lee vs. Marvel, copyright wrangles seem to be an omnipresent feature of the industry.

Such wrangles aren't confined to big name publishers or big name titles either. Earlier this month, JMS and Image were hit with a [legal challenge from Richard Hamilton](http://www.blastr.com/2013-7-3/straczynksis-new-superhero-battles-copyright-infringement-claim) (of Dial "C" for Comics) over the character The Cowl/The Red Cowl in JMS' upcoming Image project "Sidekicks". Depending on what you read, this claim actually stems from an *unpublished* comic. If that's right, and Hamilton wins his case anyway, it would be a game changing interpretation of copyright.  Proving publication dates, etc., can be complex enough - proving exactly when someone came up an *idea* would be infinitely more complex.

As an independent comic creator, creating IP as essentially what you do. It's inevitable that there will be some cross overs and there's nothing new under the sun. However, the industry does seem weighted in favour of the infringer, at least in the first instance. How many times a month should you be Googling your indie comics project to make sure someone hasn't come along and scooped up your name? In Marvel's defence it's pretty hard to turn up Will's posting of Agents of T.I.M.E from back in 2011, probably because the title never appears in the text only in the image, and similar searches mostly bring back the [Time Agency from Doctor Who](https://www.google.co.uk/search?q=time+agents), but should a search engine really be how we establish if our *brilliant new idea* is virgin territory or not? Once the infringing content is out there, the genie has well and truly left the bottle and going toe to toe with some of these corporate giants is a pretty daunting prospect.

I wish Will the best and hope he is able to make some progress with Marvel on this. It would be gratifying to see the publisher acknowledge a creator's concerns and come to some arrangement. Whether you personally agree that there's a fair claim here of infringement or not, the worst possible outcome would be to see a grass roots comic advocate like Will ignored by the House of Mouse.

(Please note, the *brilliant idea* to create a comic called "Virgin Territory" is now officially mine... at least until I Google it).
