Exactly where this short will be turning up is under wraps at the moment, but if you like time travel, vampires, nazis, steampunk contraptions and villians with clockwork legs, then it is safe to say that this is the story that will deliver for you!

Whilst Terry is working away on the artwork, he's put together this rather nifty logo as a little teaser for the story. Feel free to pinch it, post it, and link to it.
