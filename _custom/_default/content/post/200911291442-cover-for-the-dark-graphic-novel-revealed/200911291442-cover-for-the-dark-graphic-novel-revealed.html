Regular readers will know that I have been working on this project with Rick Lundeen for Markosia since May of 2009 and, having finished the script just a few weeks it ago, I am  incredibly excited to see the cover sitting alongside other previews for Markosia's 2010 line.

Finishing the last chapter of the story was probably one of the toughest things I have had to do as a writer, mostly because I don't think I wanted to let any of the characters go. I hope that's a good thing. Maybe they didn't want to go either. They're tough bastards.

The Dark will be being solicited through Diamond to all good comic shops (more news on that when I have it) and will also be available through book stores, Amazon, etc. More information on that as I have it ...
