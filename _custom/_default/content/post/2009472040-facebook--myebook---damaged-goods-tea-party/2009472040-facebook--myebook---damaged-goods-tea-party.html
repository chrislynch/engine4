#Facebook | Myebook - Damaged Goods: Tea Party#

Fellow Cardiffian Rich McAuliffe has a new horror anthology coming up through Insomnia Publications.

As a bastion of the horror anthology, I could do no less than heartily recommend you give the <a href="http://www.facebook.com/ext/share.php?sid=64480228729&amp;h=xJyN8&amp;u=Nowvo&amp;ref=nf">Damaged Goods: Tea Party</a> online sampler a try.

Perhaps this is the start of the "Welsh Invasion" into UK comics, to mirror the famed "UK Invasion". Alternatively, McAuliffe may just be another sick little Welsh monkey ... like me.

Either way, it's good.
