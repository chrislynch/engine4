@Title:Bubble Version 0 6 Released

## Splash Pages A-Go-Go


[Peter Rogers](http://peter-rogers.com/) pointed out that you can *almost* make Bubble say "Splash Page" if you don't bother to mark out any panels (with `##`) on your page and crack straight on with descriptions, dialogue, etc.

The clever sausage then pointed out that it should be *easy* for Bubble to spot this. Fair play, the man's not wrong.

So, one quick patch later, we've got a new version of Bubble that understand that **(0 PANELS)** looks a lot cooler when it says **(SPLASH PAGE)**.

## Example Splash Page Notation

Here's an example Bubble script with a splash page - copy and paste it across to the Bubble app to see how it works.

	#

	A dragon eating a building in a war-torn city,

	#

	## Police cars racing through war-torn city streets.
	## Inside the lead police car, two tough looking cops

	  I'm getting too old for this... god-damn splash pages, turning up out of nowhere.
