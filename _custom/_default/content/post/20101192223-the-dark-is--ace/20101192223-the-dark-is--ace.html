@Title:The Dark Is  Ace

#The Dark Is ... Ace!#

OK, you'll need to excuse the pun. Ace is a superlative I don't think I've used since junior school. I put it away in the <em>big-box-of-words-I-no-longer-use</em> along with "mega", "brill" (except when referring to the fish), and "wicked" (except when describing witches and rather nifty anthology comics from FutureQuake Press.

The guys at Ace are proper comics retailers - passionate about the medium, supportive of homegrown talent, and damn good people across the board. We need more guys like this, out there on the front line. So, <a href="http://www.acecomics.co.uk/">visit the site</a>.

<em>That is all ...</em>
