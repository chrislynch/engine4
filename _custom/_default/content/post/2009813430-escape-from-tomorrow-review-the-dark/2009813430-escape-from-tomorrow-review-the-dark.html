@Title:Escape From Tomorrow Review The Dark

#Escape From Tomorrow Review The Dark#

Zaius of Escape from Tomorrow as reviewed the preview edition of The Dark, Issue 1.
<blockquote>I read the 8 page preview issue that Markosia have released and really enjoyed it. The writing was nicely paced and the dialogue felt real: the fight scenes had a real sense of danger whilst the opening panels, set in a hospital room as the scientist sits alongside his wife's bed, had a genuine feel of desperation, of regret. Likewise, the artwork was very much to my own personal taste - clean, confident, subtle colouring.

It seems to me Markosia have found an ideal approach here by releasing the single issues digitally and then following up with a printed volume. Based on the strength of this preview issue I would be happy to pay for the digital downloads and then buy the printed collected edition.</blockquote>
