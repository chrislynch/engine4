@Title:Robots Reviewed At Newsarama

#Robots Reviewed At Newsarama#

Newsarama's "Best Shots" have declared Accent UK's "Robots" Anthology a success, despite their jaded views on the world of anthology comics. It's great to see the Accent UK anthologies getting the recognition they deserve, not least because Robots features "And Man Begat" by myself and Stu.Art and the upcoming "Victoriana" is set to feature "The Clockwork Occultist" by Terry Cooper and I.

To quote Newarama's wise words ...
<blockquote><em>"Robots is a better anthology than Image’s </em><strong><em>Popgun</em></strong><em>."</em></blockquote>
