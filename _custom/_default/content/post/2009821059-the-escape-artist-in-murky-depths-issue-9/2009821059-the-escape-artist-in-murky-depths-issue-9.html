#The Escape Artist In Murky Depths Issue 9#

"The Escape Artist", the first collaboration between myself and Rick Lundeen (artist on "The Dark"), is now available in <a href="http://www.murkydepths.com">Murky Depths issue #9</a>.

A tale of magic, love, death, and ouija boards, it will hopefully chill the spine and warm the heart in equal measure.

For anyone who hasn't seen Rick's artwork on this, here's a sneak preview ...
