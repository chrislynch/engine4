Yesterday "The Dark" and "Freeman of the Armed Services" were officially launched at Ace Comics in Richmond. Behold, the beautiful picture of creators and books below ...

First off, many thanks to Ace for hosting the signing. If you've never been, it is an absolutely great store. Lovely layout, brilliant stock, and really great staff ... a true gem. It also seems pretty easy to get to, at least if the District Line is running (more on <em>that</em> later, thankfully I was chauffer driven to London like the fabulous celebrity I am).

The signing went very well, with lots of very positive feedback on the book. A lot of people already knew about the book as well, so it's good to know that all the podcasting and reviewer stalking has been worth it and everyone's support for the book is working.

Obviously London is fair distance from my usual stomping grounds and with my FP signing, Cribbs Causeway, and then Bristol not <em>that</em> far around the corner, I was hard pressed to convince many of the faithful that they should make the epic journey to the big smoke. Fortunately, <a href="http://artyougrewupwith.com/">Huw J</a> is quite clearly the King of London, knows just about everyone, and was immensely gracious in sending many of his visitors, friends, family, etc. my way to take a look at Te Dark.

Despite it being as difficult to pitch without spoilers as ever, a number of people bought copies and hopefully they enjoy the book and appreciate me not giving away any secrets!

So, one down and many to go. <a href="http://www.facebook.com/event.php?eid=328755030929">My next signing is in the evening on April 8th at Forbidden Planet in Cardiff</a>. This is the home town gig, and hopefully I'll see you there!
