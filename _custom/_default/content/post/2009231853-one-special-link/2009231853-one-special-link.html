@Title:One Special Link

		   #One Special Link#
When I was updating my links today, I was in for a big surprise.

Wes Packer has been quitely blogging away while I wasn't looking, building up an impressive set of links and chronicalling his life since he left the world of stand up comedy and Microsoft programming and joined me in the glorious world of Open Source. (Which is quite a coup, considering it was Wes would took me through the back of the wardrobe to Narnia some years ago!).

He's even been Twitter-ing, which I've been too lazy to do as yet.

Well worth a read for Wes' trademark mix of tech, politics, philosophy, and Wesishness.
