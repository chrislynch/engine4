@Title:Returning To Writing And Returning To The Blog

		   #Returning To Writing And Returning To The Blog#
It has been a long hiatus.

My amazing wife and I had twins (had being an odd word to use, as we still have them now) and I mistakenly thought writing would continue as usual. I also changed job, becoming CTO of a very exciting new business called <a title="eCommerce Centric" href="http://www.ecommercecentric.co.uk">eCommerce Centric</a>. And then we moved house.

Life, as they say, happened.

So, tonight I did a something that I have not done in a very long time - I wrote a short script, and sent it off to an anthology to see if I can somehow worm my way into their pages. I have the butterflies back, those little editorial butterflies that swim around inside you and ask if you did enough proof reading. I've missed them, in all their fluttery glory.

I'm also posting to the blog for the first time in a very long time.

Hello. I'm back. Glad you are still here.

You are here, <em>aren't you</em>?
