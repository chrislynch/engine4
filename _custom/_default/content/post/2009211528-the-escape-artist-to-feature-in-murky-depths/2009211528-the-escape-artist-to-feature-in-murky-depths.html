@Title:The Escape Artist To Feature In Murky Depths

#The Escape Artist To Feature In Murky Depths#

Those fine folks at Murky Depths will be publishing my new short horror strip "The Escape Artist" in an upcoming edition of their quarterly tome of genre fiction.

No word on an artist as yet, I'll post as soon as I know, but if you like water traps, dirty cafes, and murderous ghosts ... <em>this one has it all!</em>
