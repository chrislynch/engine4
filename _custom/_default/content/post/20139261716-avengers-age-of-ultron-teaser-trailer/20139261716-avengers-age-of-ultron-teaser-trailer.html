@Title:Avengers Age of Ultron Teaser Trailer

Hand-held footage of Marvel's' "Avengers 2: Age of Ultron" teaser from Comic-Con was posted to YouTube early this week and subsequently pulled after Disney's lawyers went into a hulk-like rage over the leak from Hall H (allegedly). Today, Taiwanese "Tony Stark Channel" has uploaded a hi-def version of the teaser, featuring voiceovers taken from the first "Avengers" film while Stark's Iron Man helmet is hammered into the shape of Ultron's head. Watch it while you can.

Here are a few things that this trailer might be telling us...

## We won't see James Spader's face

Ultron, in this teaser, looks just like Ultron from the comic books - right down to a gaping maw full of Kirby-esque energy. Does this mean we won't see Spader at all? Perhaps it means that Spader will pull double duty as Ultron **and Hank Pym**. Is it too far fetched for the ultra-egotistical Pym to give his own voice to his creation? I doubt it.

## Tony Stark might be Hank Pym

We've already had a engineer/scientist spurned by Tony Stark as the villain in Iron Man 3, but there does seem to be a link in this trailer between Iron Man and Ultron. Stark did presumably leave a lot of Iron Man components laying around when he detonated his Iron Man suits and the final Iron Man suit did seem to have a life of its own... After turning an emotional corner first in Avengers and then in Iron Man 3, are we about to see Tony Stark screw up again? Remember, he "doesn't play well with others".

## It's all going to go very, very wrong

"They'll come back, because we'll need them to..."
