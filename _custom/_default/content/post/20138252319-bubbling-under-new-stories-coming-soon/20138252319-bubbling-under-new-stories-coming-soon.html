@Title:Bubbling Under: New stories coming soon

Sometimes I need to take a break from The Magpye and get my hands dirty on another story for a while. Switching genres and, if I'm working in comics instead of prose, switching mediums helps to keep my brain moving. Giving The Magpye and its cavalcade of characters some time to cool down now and then is good for me too. They need to clean the blood out of their hair and reload.


I'm also a proponent of the "eat your own dog food" school of software development, so writing comics also gives me a chance to sit on the writer's side of Bubble and make sure I didn't ***break it***. I'm guessing I haven't, because both of my "coming soon"/next-to-be-published comic stories were written in Bubble and submitted to the publisher using Bubble's formatting.

Here they are...

## Who Killed Judy Baker? ##

A short story for [The Psychadelic Journal of Time Travel](http://thepsychedelicjournal.blogspot.co.uk/). This is probably one of the most self-evidently "dark" stories that I've ever written, with a moribund protagonist searching for some answers (and meaning) to his life by plunging himself back into his own time-stream. It has been brilliantly illustrated by [Tom Newell](http://tomjnewell.com/) and will be hitting the brains of the buying public at the official launch of Issue 2 of The Psychadelic Journal of Time Travel at [Melksham Comic Con](http://melkshamcomiccon.co.uk/) next week.

## He Says We Have A Future ##

A six page story that talks a lot about love, and the lengths we will go for it, due to be published in Keyhole Comics "Unlocked: Future Games" anthology later this year. This story has been illustrated by [the incomparable Terry Cooper](http://www.terrycooperart.blogspot.co.uk/), who I hope to be working with again very soon.

## More Shiny to follow ##

I've got some more *shiny news* that I'm sitting on at the moment and I'm waiting to hear back on a few other scripts so expect another post soon. Well, as soon as I know anything, anyway.
