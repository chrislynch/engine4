The IT Crowd is back for one last episode. Naturally, I'm excited.

Having worked in IT all my professional life, this was pretty much the comedy made for me. Unlike many other things that *looked* like they were me, this one really was. Back when I worked in the NHS, this was my life on the small screen.

What is really remarkable about this show is that despite being heavy seasoned with IT references, it doesn't date. The real comedy is about people, and characters, and remains one of the best things Channel 4 have ever put out in my opinion. 

Set yourself up with an email reminder to your smartphone via a Web 2.0 service. Or write it on the back of your hand. Either way, don't miss it.
