@Title:Celtx Doubles Its User Base To 4 Million

Celtx, the "free as in beer" pre-production scripting tool, is growing rapidly and almost certainly shaking things up at *Final Draft* headquarters as it makes in roads to **NBC Universal** and other major studios.


In April 2012, Celtx had almost two millions users. Today, Celtx has 4.6 million users (Source: [Herald Business](http://thechronicleherald.ca/business/1124725-entrevestor-celtx-s-growth-makes-huge-leap)) and more and more of them are upgrading from the free service to the paid for versions of the software.

Whilst I am no longer the Celtx fan that I used to be, it is great to see a product like this growing and making a difference in an otherwise pretty turgid part of the software industry. I hate the attitude that some writers have that you have to be using a particular piece of software if you are "serious" about your writing. Nobody, and I mean _nobody_ needs to spend hundreds of pounds/dollars just to get started putting their ideas together, and owning the same software as JJ Abrams doesn't mean you are going to write the next Star Trek (or, thankfully, *Cloverfield*).

Final Draft's website claims that "For the last 20 years, nearly every film and television show has been scripted with Final Draft software.". Let's see if that's still true in 2014, shall we?
