The series once again teams Millar with fan-favourite artist Steve McNiven and basically asks the question, the quote Millar himself, "What if Batman were a c*nt?"

Whilst the premise may not seem <em>that</em> original when compared to DC's existing "Negative Batman", Owlman of Earth 2, the few snippets available on the web do promise some definite bar-raising in terms of the level of death and destruction one man with a mask and a fancy belt is going to cause. A lot of people blast Millar for being too commercial, for writing comics deliberately for the screen, and for his general self-agrandising and publicity whoring but I am rarely one of them.

Mostly because I would be just as bad, given half a chance ;-)

So, from one comics publicity whore to another, if you haven't read it yet, cast your eyes over this rather interesting interview at CBR ... <a href="http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=23934">"Nemesis" Asks: What if Batman was The Joker? - Comic Book Resources</a>.
