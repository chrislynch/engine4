What's more disturbing; that there <em>is</em> an aboriginal trickster god famed for his incestuous ways, or that I <em>write</em> about him? 

In any case, Gary has done a fantastic job and Bamapana looks utterly filthy and profane, just as he should. Fans of EC horror, tentacles, night clubbing, betrayal, and evil tables (yes, <em>evil tables</em>) should all do just fine. Kitten fanciers ... not so much.

Check the story out in the upcoming "Choices" anthology from <a href="http://theredeyed.blogspot.com/">Insomnia</a>, and prepare to come face to face with Bamapana ...
