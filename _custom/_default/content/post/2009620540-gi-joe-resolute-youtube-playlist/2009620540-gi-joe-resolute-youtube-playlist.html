#GI Joe: Resolute (YouTube Playlist)#

For anyone who hasn't already heard, <a href="http://http://www.hasbro.com/resolute/en_US/">GI Joe Resolute</a> is an eleven episode animated series based on the 'Joe franchise written by UK scribe Warren Ellis.

Originally broadcast on the [adult swim] network, this is certainly a more mature take on the franchise, the cartoon that adult fans of the 'Joe franchise will no doubt refer to as "The GI Joe Cartoon we've been waiting for".

Having seen the trailers for the new "Rise of Cobra" 'Joe movie, and eyed the "accelerator suits" with some suspicion (unless it leads to a GI Joes/Transformers crossover movie that is), I thought I'd make sure that anyone who hasn't stumbled across Resolute has it as an example of what the 'Joes can do.

Sit down and seriously digest.
