@Title:This Is  Bleeding Cool

#This Is ... Bleeding Cool#

I am no doubt so far behind the curve with this blog post that you may be forgiven for thinking that you are in my ancient archives or that brand new shiny broadband is some how connected to the past.

But fear not. I am just tardy. Slow. Late.

Never the less, just in case there are people out there that are even more tardy than me, I recommend that you check out <a href="http://www.bleedingcool.com">Rich Johnson's new "Bleeding Cool" website</a>. Imagine Lying in the Gutters, but on a daily basis and with a smattering of Warren Ellis column-age to spice things up. And forums.

As I say, it's ... bleeding cool.
