@Title:Dark Issue 3 Sketchbook

#Dark Issue 3 Sketchbook#

Writing Issue 3 of "The Dark" called for a plethora of new and nightmarish characters. I honestly did wonder what artist-extraordinary Rick Lundeen would make of some of my requests ...

Turns out, he's even sicker than I am.

Without further preamble, I proudly ... yes, <em>proudly</em> ... present two of the horrors that are being created for Issue 3 of The Dark.

<strong>Doctor Needles</strong>

The Doctor is in; part doctor, part dentist, part cyborg, and part giant spider. He is, basically, every childhood horror and nightmare that you ever had.

Just don't ask what Rick has hidden behind those glasses.

<strong>Fungus</strong>

Fungus is living (well, <em>mostly </em>living) vegetable matter. Puss, goo, ooze, and slime are his best bits. Try not to ask about the rest.
