#Waiting For The Trade Podcast Review Of The Dark#

Many thanks to Dave at Waiting for the Trade (They like big books and they cannot lie) for featuring The Dark on the <a href="http://wftt.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=584827">latest episode of the WFTT Podcast</a>.

Dave will put a full review up on the website in due course, but for now I am more than happy to hear someone so exercised by the idea of Memetech and getting so engaged with the story. Hopefully Dave will be equally happy when he's reached the second half and all of the secrets have been revealed.

Don't take my word for it though, <a href="http://wftt.libsyn.com/index.php?post_id=584827">listen to Waiting for the Trade</a>.
