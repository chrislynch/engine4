@Title:I Will Fight Terry Deary For The Library

I began to draft a blog post called "Thank you, Terry Deary" today in response to the author's well reported attack on libraries. However, I have realised that someone already said it better.


For Mr. Terry Deary, here is Taylor Mali's incredible and inspiring "I Will Fight You For the Library".

And in case that makes it unclear, here is what I am saying...

Dear Mr. Terry Deary.

Thank you for reminding me what an immense priviledge it is to be a writer. Thank you for reminding me that everytime someone picks up one of my books or stories and reads it that they are giving me the greatest gift that any one human can give another - they are giving me their time, and their mind, to do with as I will. They are connecting with me and creating an exchange that has a value so far beyond monetary value, so vast in its scope, that it is easy to miss it entirely.

Thank you for reminding me that I do not write for the money, but I write because I love to write. Thank you for spurring me to write more, and to give more, simply to spite you.

And thank you for reminding me how important libraries are. As I wrote my original post I looked at photographs of my twin sons and came to the sudden realisation that if anyone had the gall to tell me that **they** could not read a book, could not have access to a book, simply because of money? Then would fight them for the library. I would fight them.

You are very quick to point out what you consider to be out-moded ideas, Mr. Deary. Perhaps you should consider that the most outmoded idea of all is that books and knowledge and information are the domain of the privledged and the affluent only and use the platform that your readers have given you to elevate them, not sabotage them.

Time to wake up, Mr. Deary. Your ideas are history (and a horrible one at that).
