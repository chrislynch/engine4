### Linking to images and files

You can use Markdown or HTML style images in your content.

When linking to files or images, you can enter just the filename *if* the file lives in the same
folder as the file that you are currently editing. The system will automatically locate the file
and ensure that the link in the webpage is correct when displaying your content to readers.

If the file is not on the same path as the file that you are editing, use a full or relative
path. The system will also detect this, and should leave your content unchanged when displaying it to 
readers.

### Help! The file isn't editable! ###

If the file has appeared as `plaintext` and cannot be changed, this means that the file
is read-only on the server. Contact your system administrator to resolve this problem if
you believe that you should be able to change this file.
