Use the Content Explorer (opposite) to locate the file that you want to edit.

Remember that the content for a path on your website is likely to be in the **1.content** folder,
and should *then* follow the same path as the URL.

Use the **New Path/Directory** option to create a new path (folder) on your website. Remember to do this
*inside* **1.content** to create content for the site.

When you have created your new path, create files inside the new path's folder to add content using the
**New Text File** option.

Acceptable filetypes are `.txt`, `.text`, `.htm`, `.html`, `.md`, and `.markdown`.
Unlike previous versions of the software, the name of the file **does not** need to match the name
of the parent directory. Give your file a useful and informative name that will help you recognise it later.

All of these files will be processed through the **Markdown** filter, so you can use Markdown as a quick
and easy way to create content. For help on Markdown, go to the [Daring Fireball](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/basics) website.

To add images and downloadable files to your content, use the **Upload File** option. This will upload binary
and text files into the current directory.
