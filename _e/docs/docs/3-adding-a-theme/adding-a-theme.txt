# Building a theme for engine4 

If you like repeating the same blocks of code over and over again, and then maintaining those same
blocks of code over and over again, engine4 doesn't *need* a theme, and you can go now.

Still here? OK, good. I'm glad those other guys are gone. They were *weird* (or COBOL developers, maybe).

Anyway, hopefully by now you've latched onto the idea of creating a HTML template and using that
to output the content from your engine4 `content` directory.

That's what the `theme` directory is for.

engine4 will process your `theme/` subdirectory in the same way that it processes `content/`. 
The key difference is that theme gets processed *after* content (because, alphabetically, it comes later)
and in your theme directory we are going to put some `.php` files.

These .php files are going to print stuff out, which engine4 will notice. 
When engine4 notices that something has been printed out, it won't attempt any other output itself.
