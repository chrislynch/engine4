# Building a simple website with engine4

engine4 uses one or more subdirectories of the root folder, the folder containing `index.php`
to build the webpage that it returns.

There can be **any** number of folders, and they are always loaded and processed in alphabetical order.

engine4 will ignore any folder that starts with `_` like, for example, the `_e` directory.

For each folder that it encounters, engine4 will attempt to match the directory path that was
requested by the web browser to a subdirectory of the folder being processed. 
If it cannot find a match, it will move up level in the directory hierarchy until it either finds
a match or reaches the root of the folder.

### Example

1. We create a `content` folder inside our engine4 installation.
1. We request `http://localhost/engine4/give/me/help` from our browser.
1. engine4 scans the installed directory for folders and finds
    1. _e/
    1. content/
1. _e/ is ignored
1. content is processed
    1. We look for files in `content/give/me/help`. If no files exist or the directory is missing we move on to
    1. Looking for files in `content/give/me/` then
    1. Looking for files in `content/give/` and finally
    1. Looking for files in `content/`

When files are found, the system stops working up the hierarchy, and loads these files.

## engine4 file types

engine4 recognises .htm, .html, .txt, .text, .md, and .markdown as valid content files.

engine4 also recognises .php files (typically used for themes, but applicable anywhere)

If engine4 encounters an unrecognised filetype, it will attempt to reads its MIME information.
Binary files are ignored. Text files are loaded, where possible.

### engine4 and *Markdown*

When it encounters a .txt, .text, .md, or .markdown file, engine4 will assume that the content
needs to be parsed for Markdown syntax.

engine4 uses **phpmarkdownextra* (included in the `_e/lib/phpmarkdown` folder) for this task.

## Make sense? OK, time to go ahead and **create some content**

1. Create your own `content` folder.
1. Create an `index.txt` file in this folder
1. Put some content into the index.txt file. This is your homepage content
1. Now create a directory called about *inside* the content directory
1. Create an `about.txt` file in this directory
1. Put some more content in the about.txt file
1. Go to your website and look at the homepage, your content from index.txt should be there.
1. Go to *your website*/about. Your content from the about page should be there.

That's it. No CMS, no fiddling around. You write, you save, you've published.

*Except* your website isn't looking very pretty, is it? No, for the pretty-making you need to
