# Installing engine4

Download a copy of the software from the [engine4 GitHub repository](https://github.com/chrislynch/engine4)
and unpack it into the root of the folder you want to run your website from.

And ... that's it.

So, what exactly did we just do?

Well, the downloaded code should contain the following files:

1. .htaccess file
1. index.php
1. _e/ folder

### .htaccess

The .htaccess file includes `ModRewrite` configuration to redirect all page requests to 
engine4's `index.php` file.

### index.php

This is a sample index file that simply calls/includes the file `_e/e.php` to start off
the engine4 framework.

### _e folder

This folder contains the engine4 framework.

In the root of the folder is the file `e.php`, which contains the class definition for class `e`
and code to instantiate this class and run the `e->go()` function.

In addition to this there are 4 subdirectories.

1. css
1. docs
1. lib
1. plugins

#### css

The css folder contains sample CSS files that can be used with your engine4 applications.

This documentation uses the `css/doc/doc.css` stylesheet.

#### docs

The `docs` folder contains this very documentation, which is being rendered by the engine4 installation itself.

#### lib

The `lib` folder contains a set of 3rd party libraries chosen to be a part of the framework.

Including are

1. PHPMailer
1. BluePrint CSS
1. Colorbox
1. phpMarkDownExtra

#### plugins

The `plugins` folder is a placeholder folder for plugins that will be used/available for the engine4 framework.

There are no complete plugins at this time, but the `loadplugin()` function of the `e class` exists to load them.

## So, what **did** we just do?

If you run the index.php file (for example by going to http://localhost/engine4, if that's where
you installed the framework) you will see a blank page. That's because we have no content and 
no theme with which to render it.
