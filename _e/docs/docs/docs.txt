## What is engine4?

engine4 is an "anti-framework", a framework that does not require you to work in a
particular way or to subscribe to a particular methodology. There is no MVC, no MVVM. 
It doesn't drop twenty plus directories into your application or make you do anything you *don't* want to do.

engine4's only job is kickstart your development with a core library to handle the
job of pulling the various parts of your application together, a set of selected
common libraries to save you time in picking and choosing 3rd party components, 
and a set of "helper" classes to take the pain out of day-to-day tasks.

## Who built engine4?

engine4 was built by [Chris Lynch](http://www.planetofthepenguins.com), CTO of [eCommerce Centric](http://www.ecommercecentric.co.uk).
